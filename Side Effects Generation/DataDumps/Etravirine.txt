==Indications and dosage==
Etravirine, in combination with other anti-retrovirals, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in antiretroviral treatment-experienced adult patients, who have evidence of viral replication and HIV-1 strains resistant to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and other antiretroviral agents. 

The recommended dose of etravirine is 200&nbsp;mg (2 x 100&nbsp;mg tablets, or 1 x 200&nbsp;mg tablet as of 03/18/2011) taken twice daily following a meal. The type of food does not affect the exposure to etravirine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/022187s008lbl.pdf |title=Intelence prescribing information |accessdate=January 2012 |format=pdf |work=FDA}}</ref>

==Contraindication==
Each 100&nbsp;mg etravirine tablet contains 160&nbsp;mg of [[lactose]]. Patients with rare hereditary problems of [[galactose]] intolerance, the Lapp [[lactase deficiency]] or [[glucose-galactose malabsorption]] should not take this medicine.<ref>{{cite web |title=Etravine: Summary of product characteristics |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000900/WC500034180.pdf |page=5 |publisher=[[European Medicines Agency|EMEA]] |accessdate=July 2011}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Etravirine is a second-generation [[non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] (NNRTI), designed to be active against HIV with mutations that confer resistance to the two most commonly prescribed first-generation NNRTIs, mutation K103N for [[efavirenz]] and Y181C for [[nevirapine]].<ref name="David Evans">{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsmeds.com/articles/etravirine_tmc125_hiv_2042_13846.shtml |title=Etravirine—Countdown to Launch |accessdate=2008-02-02 |author=Evans, David |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2008-01-15 |work= |publisher=AIDSmeds.com |pages= |language= |quote=}}</ref>  This potency appears to be related to etravirine's flexibility as a molecule. Etravirine is a [[diarylpyrimidine]] (DAPY), a type of [[organic molecule]] with some [[conformational isomerism]] that can bind the enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]] in multiple [[Protein conformation|conformations]], allowing for a more robust interaction between etravirine and the enzyme, even in the presence of mutations.<ref name="pmid15115397">{{cite journal |author=Das K, Clark AD, Lewi PJ, Heeres J, De Jonge MR, Koymans LM, Vinkers HM, Daeyaert F, Ludovici DW, Kukla MJ, De Corte B, Kavash RW, Ho CY, Ye H, Lichtenstein MA, Andries K, Pauwels R, De Béthune MP, Boyer PL, Clark P, Hughes SH, Janssen PA, Arnold E |title=Roles of conformational and positional adaptability in structure-based design of TMC125-R165335 (etravirine) and related non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors that are highly potent and effective against wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1 variants |journal=J.

==Warnings and risks==
In 2009, the prescribing information for etravirine was modified to include "postmarketing reports of cases of [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] and [[erythema multiforme]], as well as [[hypersensitivity]] reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including [[liver failure]]. Intelence therapy should be immediately discontinued when signs and symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm180579.htm |title=FDA Medwatch Safety Information |accessdate=2009-08-27 |work=}}</ref>
