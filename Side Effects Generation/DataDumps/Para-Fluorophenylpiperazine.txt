'''''para''-Fluorophenylpiperazine''' ('''pFPP''', '''4-FPP''', '''4-Fluorophenylpiperazine'''; '''Fluoperazine''', '''Flipiperazine''') is a [[piperazine]] derivative with mildly [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] and [[euphoriant]] effects.<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=62575 Erowid Experience Vaults: Piperazines - pFPP - Refreshing Enhancement - 62575]</ref><ref>[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=56641 Erowid Experience Vaults: Piperazines - pFPP - A Little Flip'd Out - 56641]</ref> It has been sold as an ingredient in legal [[recreational drugs]] known as "[[Party pills]]", initially in [[New Zealand]] and subsequently in other countries around the world.<ref>King LA. Forensic Chemistry of Substance Misuse. A Guide to Drug Control. Royal Society of Chemistry. (2009) pp 100–102. {{ISBN|978-0-85404-178-7}}</ref>

pFPP has been found ''[[in vitro]]'' to act mainly as a [[5-HT1A|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]], with some additional affinity for the [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] and [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]]s. It has also been shown to [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]], and to possibly induce their [[releasing agent|release]].

pFPP was originally discovered as a [[metabolite]] of the hypnotic antihistamine [[niaprazine]] in 1982,<ref>Keane PE, Strolin Benedetti M, Dow J. The effect of niaprazine on the turnover of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the rat brain. Neuropharmacology. 1982 Feb;21(2):163-9.</ref> but was rediscovered in 2003 as a potential recreational drug, and sold as an ingredient in "Party pills" in New Zealand, under brand names such as "The Big Grin", "Mashed", and "Extreme Beans". Subsequently it has continued to be used as an ingredient in black market "ecstasy" pills around the world.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/mg0809/mg0809.pdf DEA Microgram Bulletin August 2009]</ref>

pFPP has little stimulant effects, with its subjective effects derived mainly from its action as a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist.<ref>Scherman D, Hamon M, Gozlan H, Henry JP, Lesage A, Masson M, Rumigny JF. Molecular pharmacology of niaprazine. Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry. 1988;12(6):989-1001.</ref> pFPP is active at doses between 20 and 150&nbsp;mg, but higher doses cause a range of side-effects such as [[migraine]] [[headache]]s, [[muscle ache]]s, [[anxiety]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]]. Metabolic studies have shown pFPP to be an inhibitor of various [[Cytochrome P450]] enzymes in the liver which may contribute to its side-effect profile.<ref name="pmid19589229">{{cite journal |vauthors=Antia U, Tingle MD, Russell BR |title=Metabolic interactions with piperazine-based 'party pill' drugs |journal=The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology |volume=61 |issue=7 |pages=877–82 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19589229 |doi=10.1211/jpp/61.07.0006 |url=}}</ref>

Based on the recommendation of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with a number of other piperazine derivatives, into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on December 18, 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs remained until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.<ref>[http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/d/3/d/00DBHOH_BILL8220_1-Misuse-of-Drugs-Classification-of-BZP-Amendment.htm Misuse of Drugs (Classification of BZP) Amendment Bill 2008]</ref>  This drug has been detected in a drug-facilitated sexual assault case in the United States of America.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
