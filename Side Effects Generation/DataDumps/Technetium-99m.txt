[[File:Tc99minjektion.jpg|thumb|right|A technetium injection contained in a shielded syringe]]
'''Technetium-99m''' is a [[metastable]] [[nuclear isomer]] of [[technetium-99]] (itself an isotope of [[technetium]]), symbolized as <sup>99m</sup>Tc, that is used in tens of millions of medical diagnostic procedures annually, making it the most commonly used [[Radiopharmacology|medical radioisotope]].

Technetium-99m is used as a [[radioactive tracer]] and can be detected in the body by medical equipment ([[gamma camera]]s). It is well suited to the role, because it emits readily detectable [[gamma ray]]s with a [[photon energy]] of 140&nbsp;[[kiloelectronvolt|keV]] (these 8.8&nbsp;pm [[photon]]s are about the same wavelength as emitted by conventional X-ray diagnostic equipment) and its [[half-life]] for gamma emission is 6.0058 hours (meaning 93.7% of it decays to <sup>99</sup>Tc in 24 hours). The relatively "short" physical [[half-life]] of the isotope and its [[biological half-life]] of 1 day (in terms of human activity and metabolism) allows for scanning procedures which collect data rapidly but keep total patient radiation exposure low. The same characteristics make the isotope suitable only for diagnostic but never therapeutic use.

Technetium-99m was discovered as a product of [[cyclotron]] bombardment of [[molybdenum]]. This procedure produced [[molybdenum-99]], a radionuclide with a longer half-life (2.75 days), which decays to Tc-99m. At present, molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) is used commercially as the easily transportable source of medically used Tc-99m. In turn, this Mo-99 is usually created commercially by fission of [[highly enriched uranium]] in aging research and material testing nuclear reactors in several countries.

==History==
===Discovery===
In 1938 [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] isolated for the first time the [[metastable isotope]] technetium-99m, after bombarding natural molybdenum with 8 MeV [[deuteron]]s in the {{convert|37|inch|adj=on}} [[cyclotron]] of [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence]]'s [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation laboratory]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Segrè|first=Emilio|last2=Seaborg|first2=Glenn T.|title=Nuclear Isomerism in Element 43|journal=Physical Review|date=1 November 1938|volume=54|issue=9|pages=772–772|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.54.772.2|bibcode = 1938PhRv...54..772S }}</ref> In 1970 Seaborg explained that:<ref>{{harvnb|Hoffmann|Ghiorso|Seaborg|2000 |pp =15–16}}</ref>

{{Quote|we discovered an isotope of great scientific interest, because it decayed by means of an isomeric transition with emission of a line spectrum of electrons coming from an almost completely internally converted gamma ray transition. [actually, only 12% of the decays are by internal conversion] (...) This was a form of radioactive decay which had never been observed before this time. Segrè and I were able to show that this radioactive isotope of the element with the atomic number 43 decayed with a half-life of 6.6&nbsp;h [later updated to 6.0&nbsp;h] and that it was the daughter of a 67-h [later updated to 66&nbsp;h] molybdenum parent radioactivity. This chain of decay was later shown to have the mass number 99, and (...) the 6.6-h activity acquired the designation ‘technetium-99m.}}

Later in 1940, Emilio Segrè and [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] published the experimental results of the analysis of fission products of uranium-235, among which was present molybdenum-99, and detected the 6-h activity of element 43, later labelled as technetium-99m.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Segrè|first=Emilio|author2=Wu, Chien-Shiung |title=Some Fission Products of Uranium|journal=Physical Review|year=1940|volume=57|issue=6|pages=552–552 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.57.552.3|bibcode = 1940PhRv...57..552S }}</ref>

===Early medical applications in the USA===
Tc-99m remained a scientific curiosity until the 1950s when [[Powell Richards]] realized the potential of technetium-99m as a medical radiotracer and promoted its use among the medical community. While Richards was in charge of the radioisotope production at the Hot Lab Division of the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], Walter Tucker and [[Margaret Greene]] were working on how to improve the separation process purity of the short-lived [[elution|eluted]] [[daughter product]] [[iodine-132]] from [[tellurium-132]], its 3.2-days parent, produced in the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor|url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/history/BGRR.asp|work=bnl.gov|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> They detected a trace contaminant which proved to be Tc-99m, which was coming from Mo-99 and was following tellurium in the chemistry of the separation process for other fission products. Based on the similarities between the chemistry of the tellurium-iodine parent-daughter pair, Tucker and Greene developed the first [[technetium-99m generator]] in 1958 (see photo of this generator at the beginning of the article).<ref>{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Powell|title=Technetium-99m: The Early Days|year=1989|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|location=New York|url= http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/5612212-IkoOXK/5612212.pdf|volume=BNL-43197 CONF-8909193-1|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1= W.

After build-up of Tc-99m, they could visualize the liver using the 140 keV gamma ray emission.

===Worldwide expansion===
The production and medical use of Tc-99m rapidly expanded across the world in the 1960s, benefiting from the development and continuous improvements of the [[gamma camera]]s.

;America
Between 1963 and 1966, numerous scientific studies demonstrated the use of Tc-99m as [[radiotracer]] or diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harper|first1=Pail V.|last2=Andros|first3= C. |last3=Lathop, K.|title=Preliminary observations on the use of six-hour Tc-99m as a tracer in biology and medicine|journal= Argonne Cancer Research Hospital |volume=18|pages=76–87|year= 1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harper|first1=Paul.

Production and distribution of Tc-99m generators were transferred to private companies. ''"TechneKow-CS generator"'', the first commercial tc-99m generator, was produced by Nuclear Consultants, Inc. (St. Louis, Missouri) and [[Union Carbide]] Nuclear Corporation (Tuxedo, New York).<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=W. C. |editor1-last=Eckelman|editor2-first= B.

The production of Mo-99 started in Canada in the early 1970s and was shifted to the NRU reactor in the mid 1970s.<ref>{{harvnb|Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|1997|pp=108–109}}</ref> By 1978 the reactor provided technetium-99m in large enough quantities that were processed by AECL's radiochemical division, which was privatized in 1988 as Nordion, now [[Nordion|MDS Nordion]].<ref>{{harvnb|Litt|2000|p=224 }}</ref> In the 1990s a substitution for the aging NRU reactor for production of radioisotopes was planned. The [[Multipurpose Applied Physics Lattice Experiment]] (MAPLE) was designed as a dedicated isotope-production facility. Initially, two identical MAPLE reactors were to be built at [[Chalk River Laboratories]], each capable of supplying 100% of the world's medical isotope demand. However, problems with the MAPLE 1 reactor, most notably a positive [[Nuclear chain reaction|power co-efficient of reactivity]], led to the cancellation of the project in 2008.

The first commercial Tc-99m generators were produced in [[Argentina]] in 1967, with Mo-99 produced in the [[National Atomic Energy Commission|CNEA]]'s [[RA-1 Enrico Fermi]] reactor.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Karpeles|first1=Alfredo|last2=Palcos|first2=María Cristina|title=Obtención de Generadores de Tc-99m|year=1970|volume=CNEA-267|url=http://www.cnea.gov.ar/cac/ci/CICACInformes/cicacInformeCNEA168.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2012|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=El Reactor RA - 1|url=http://www.cnea.gov.ar/xxi/reactores/RA1.asp|work=CNEA.gob.ar|accessdate=26 April 2012|language=Spanish}}</ref> Besides its domestic market CNEA supplies Mo-99 to some South American countries.<ref>{{harvnb|National Research Council|2009}}</ref>

Global shortages of technetium-99m emerged in the late 2000s because two aging nuclear reactors ([[National Research Universal Reactor|NRU]] and [[Petten nuclear reactor|HFR]]) that provided about two-thirds of the world’s supply of molybdenum-99, which itself has a half-life of only 66 hours, were shut down repeatedly for extended maintenance periods.<ref name="nyt09">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/science/24isotope.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |title=Radioactive Drug for Tests Is in Short Supply |first=Matthew L. |last=Wald |date=July 23, 2009 |ref=harv |postscript=. }}.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Radiology/NuclearMedicine/18495|title=Looming Isotope Shortage Has Clinicians Worried|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=Feb 16, 2010|accessdate=Feb 25, 2010|work=[[MedPage Today]]|ref=harv|postscript=.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ruth|first=Thomas|title=Accelerating production of medical isotopes|journal=Nature|date=29 January 2009|volume=457|issue=7229|pages=536–537|doi=10.1038/457536a|pmid=19177112|bibcode = 2009Natur.457..536R }}</ref> In May 2009 the [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] announced the detection of a small leak of [[heavy water]] in the NRU reactor that remained out of service until completion of the repairs in August 2010.

==Nuclear properties==
Technetium-99m is a metastable [[nuclear isomer]], as indicated by the "m" after its [[mass number]] 99. This means it is a [[decay product]] whose nucleus remains in an excited state that lasts much longer than is typical. The nucleus will eventually relax (i.e., de-excite) to its [[ground state]] through the emission of [[gamma ray]]s or [[internal conversion|internal conversion electron]]s. Both of these decay modes rearrange the [[nucleon]]s without [[nuclear transmutation|transmuting]] the technetium into another element.

Tc-99m decays mainly by gamma emission, slightly less than 88% of the time. (<sup>99m</sup>Tc → <sup>99</sup>Tc + γ) About 98.6% of these gamma decays result in 140.5 keV gamma rays and the remaining 1.4% are to gammas of a slightly higher energy at 142.6 keV. These are the radiations that are picked up by a gamma camera when <sup>99m</sup>Tc is used as a [[radioactive tracer]] for [[medical imaging]]. The remaining approximately 12% of <sup>99m</sup>Tc decays are by means of [[internal conversion]], resulting in ejection of high speed internal conversion electrons in several sharp peaks (as is typical of electrons from this type of decay) also at about 140 keV (<sup>99m</sup>Tc → <sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>−</sup>). These conversion electrons will [[ionizing radiation|ionize]] the surrounding matter like [[beta radiation]] electrons would do, contributing along with the 140.5 keV and 142.6 keV gammas to the total deposited [[radiation dose|dose]].

Pure gamma emission is the desirable [[decay mode]] for medical imaging because other particles deposit more energy in the patient body ([[radiation dose]]) than in the camera. Metastable isomeric transition is the only nuclear decay mode that approaches pure gamma emission.

Tc-99m's [[half life]] of 6.0058 hours is considerably longer (by 14 orders of magnitude, at least) than most nuclear isomers, though not unique. This is still a short half-life relative to many other known modes of [[radioactive decay]] and it is in the middle of the range of half lives for [[radiopharmaceutical]]s used for [[medical imaging]].

After gamma emission or internal conversion, the resulting ground-state technetium-99 then decays with a half-life of 211,000 years to [[stable isotope|stable]] [[ruthenium-99]]. This process emits soft beta radiation without a gamma. Such low radioactivity from the daughter product(s) is a desirable feature for radiopharmaceuticals.

===Technetium-99m generators===
{{Main article|technetium-99m generator}}
Technetium-99m's short half-life of 6 hours makes storage impossible and would make transport very expensive. It is instead its parent nuclide <sup>99</sup>Mo that is supplied to hospitals after its extraction from the neutron-irradiated uranium targets and its purification in dedicated processing facilities.{{#tag:ref|The Tc-99 formed by decay of Mo-99 and Tc-99m during the time of the processing is removed, together its isomer Tc-99m, at the end of the manufacturing process of the generator.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=P.

The generators, colloquially known as a moly cows, are devices designed to provide radiation shielding for transport and to minimize the extraction work done at the medical facility. A typical dose rate at 1 metre from Tc-99m generator is 20-50 [[μSv/h]] during transport.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shaw|first=Ken B.|title=Worker Exposures: How Much in the UK?|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull271/27104592527.pdf|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=IAEA Bulletin|date=Spring 1985}}</ref> These generators' output declines with time and must be replaced weekly, since the half-life of <sup>99</sup>Mo is still only 66 hours.

Molybdenum-99 spontaneously decays to excited states of <sup>99</sup>Tc through [[beta decay]]. Over 87% of the decays lead to the 142 keV excited state of Tc-99m. A {{Subatomic particle|Beta-}} [[electron]] and a {{Subatomic particle|Electron antineutrino}} [[electron antineutrino]] are emitted in the process (<sup>99</sup>Mo → <sup>99m</sup>Tc + {{Subatomic particle|Beta-}} + {{Subatomic particle|Electron antineutrino}}). The {{Subatomic particle|Beta-}} electrons are easily [[radiation shielding|shielded]] for transport, and <sup>99m</sup>Tc generators are only minor radiation hazards, mostly due to secondary X-rays produced by the electrons (also known as ''[[Bremsstrahlung]]'').

At the hospital, the <sup>99m</sup>Tc that forms through <sup>99</sup>Mo decay is chemically extracted from the technetium-99m generator. Most commercial <sup>99</sup>Mo/<sup>99m</sup>Tc generators use [[column chromatography]], in which <sup>99</sup>Mo in the form of water-soluble molybdate, MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> is [[adsorption|adsorbed]] onto acid alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). When the <sup>99</sup>Mo decays, it forms [[pertechnetate]] TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>, which, because of its single charge, is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pulling normal saline solution through the column of immobilized <sup>99</sup>MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> [[elute]]s the soluble <sup>99m</sup>TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>, resulting in a saline solution containing the <sup>99m</sup>Tc as the dissolved [[sodium pertechnetate|sodium salt of the pertechnetate]]. One technetium-99m generator, holding only a few micrograms of <sup>99</sup>Mo, can potentially diagnose 10,000 patients{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} because it will be producing <sup>99m</sup>Tc strongly for over a week.

===Preparation===
{{See also|chelation}}
Technetium exits the generator in the form of the pertechnetate ion, TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>. The [[oxidation state]] of Tc in this compound is +7. This is directly suitable for medical applications only in [[bone scan]]s (it is taken up by osteoblasts) and some thyroid scans (it is taken up in place of iodine by normal thyroid tissues). In other types of scans relying on Tc-99m, a [[reducing agent]] is added to the pertechnetate solution to bring the oxidation state of the Tc down to +3 or +4. Secondly, a [[ligand]] is added to form a [[complex (chemistry)|coordination complex]]. The ligand is chosen to have an affinity for the specific organ to be targeted. For example, the [[exametazime]] complex of Tc in oxidation state +3 is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and flow through the vessels in the brain for cerebral blood flow imaging. Other ligands include [[sestamibi]] for myocardial perfusion imaging and mercapto acetyl triglycine for [[MAG3 scan]] to measure renal function.<ref name=eck>{{cite journal|last=Eckelman|first=William C.|title=Unparalleled Contribution of Technetium-99m to Medicine Over 5 Decades|journal=JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging|year=2009|volume=2|issue=3|pages=364–368|doi=10.1016/j.jcmg.2008.12.013|url=http://imaging.onlinejacc.org/data/Journals/JCMG/22634/12013.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2012}} Historical perspective, full text</ref>

In 1970, Eckelman and Richards presented the first "kit" containing all the ingredients required to release the Tc-99m, "milked" from the generator, in the chemical form to be administered to the patient.<ref name=eck/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eckelman|first1=William C.|last2=Richards|first2= Powell|title=Instant 99mTc-DTPA.|journal=Journal of Nuclear Medicine |date=December 1970|volume=11|issue=12|pages=761|pmid=5490410|accessdate=21 July 2012|url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/11/12/761.full.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Molinski|first=Victor J.|title=A review of 99mTc generator technology|journal=The International Journal of Applied Radiation and Isotopes|date=1 October 1982|volume=33|issue=10|pages=811–819|doi=10.1016/0020-708X(82)90122-3}}</ref><ref name=Agency2008>{{cite book | title = Technetium-99m Radiopharmaceuticals: Manufacture of Kits | url = http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/trs466_web.pdf | year = 2008 | author = International Atomic Energy Agency| authorlink=International Atomic Energy Agency| isbn = 9789201004086 | accessdate = 2012-07-21|location=Vienna}}</ref>

Technetium-99m is used in 20 million diagnostic [[nuclear medicine|nuclear medical]] procedures every year. Approximately 85% of diagnostic imaging procedures in nuclear medicine use this isotope as [[radioactive tracer]]. Klaus Schwochau's book ''Technetium'' lists 31 [[radiopharmaceuticals]] based on <sup>99m</sup>Tc for imaging and functional studies of the [[brain]], [[myocardium]], [[thyroid]], [[lung]]s, [[liver]], [[gallbladder]], [[kidney]]s, [[skeleton]], [[blood]], and [[tumor]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwochau|2000|p=414}}.</ref> Depending on the procedure, the <sup>99m</sup>Tc is tagged (or bound to) a pharmaceutical that transports it to its required location. For example, when <sup>99m</sup>Tc is chemically bound to [[exametazime]] (HMPAO), the drug is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and flow through the vessels in the brain for cerebral blood-flow imaging. This combination is also used for labeling white blood cells to visualize sites of infection. [[Technetium (99mTc) sestamibi|<sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi]] is used for myocardial perfusion imaging, which shows how well the blood flows through the heart. Imaging to measure [[renal function]] is done by attaching <sup>99m</sup>Tc to mercaptoacetyl triglycine ([[MAG3]]); this procedure is known as a [[MAG3 scan]].

Technetium-99m can be readily detected in the body by medical equipment because it emits 140.5&nbsp;[[kiloelectronvolt|keV]] [[gamma ray]]s (these are about the same wavelength as emitted by conventional X-ray diagnostic equipment), and its [[half-life]] for gamma emission is six hours (meaning 94% of it decays to <sup>99</sup>Tc in 24 hours). The "short" physical [[half-life]] of the isotope and its [[biological half-life]] of 1 day (in terms of human activity and metabolism) allows for scanning procedures which collect data rapidly, but keep total patient radiation exposure low.

===Radiation side-effects===
Diagnostic treatment involving technetium-99m will result in radiation exposure to technicians, patients, and passers-by. Typical quantities of technetium administered for immunoscintigraphy tests, such as [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] tests, range from {{convert|400|to|1100|MBq|mCi|abbr=on}} ([[millicurie]] or mCi; and Mega-[[Becquerel]] or MBq) for adults.<ref name=Cardialite>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/019785s018lbl.pdf|title = Cardialite kit for the preparation of Technetium 99m Sestamibi for injection, Prescribing information, April 2008|accessdate = 2009-09-03|publisher = Food and Drug Administration|last=Squibb|first= B.-M.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=3709|title=Neurolite (bicisate dihydrochloride)|accessdate=2009-11-11|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}</ref> These doses result in radiation exposures to the patient around 10&nbsp;m[[Sievert|Sv]] (1000&nbsp;[[mrem]]), the equivalent of about 500 [[chest X-ray]] exposures.<ref name=Bedetti>{{cite journal|journal=J Am Coll Radiol|volume=5|issue=2|pages=126–31|year=2008|last1=Bedetti |first1=G. |last2=Pizzi |first2=C. |last3=Gavaruzzi |first3=G. |last4=Lugaresi |first4=F. |last5=Cicognani |first5=A. |last6=Picano |first6=E.|title=Suboptimal awareness of radiologic dose among patients undergoing cardiac stress scintigraphy|pmid=18242529|doi = 10.1016/j.jacr.2007.07.020|ref=harv|postscript=.}}</ref> This level of radiation exposure carries a 1 in 1000 lifetime risk of developing a solid cancer or leukemia in the patient.<ref>Committee to Assess the Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation, BEIR VII, National Research Council.

A spouse who stays constantly by the side of the patient through this time might receive one thousandth of patient's radiation dose this way.

The short half-life of the isotope allows for scanning procedures that collect data rapidly. The isotope is also of a very low energy level for a gamma emitter. Its ~140&nbsp;keV of energy make it safer for use because of the substantially reduced [[Ionizing radiation|ionization]] compared with other gamma emitters. The energy of gammas from <sup>99m</sup>Tc is about the same as the radiation from a commercial diagnostic X-ray machine, although the number of gammas emitted results in radiation doses more comparable to X-ray studies like [[computed tomography]].

Technetium-99m has several features that make it safer than other possible isotopes. Its gamma decay mode can be easily detected by a camera, allowing the use of smaller quantities. And because technetium-99m has a short half-life, its quick decay into the far less radioactive technetium-99 results in relatively low total radiation dose to the patient per unit of initial activity after administration, as compared to other radioisotopes. In the form administered in these medical tests (usually pertechnetate), technetium-99m and technetium-99 are eliminated from the body within a few days.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===3-D scanning technique: SPECT===
{{main article|Single photon emission computed tomography}}
[[Single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) is a [[nuclear imaging|nuclear medicine imaging technique]] using gamma rays. It may be used with any gamma-emitting isotope, including Tc-99m. In the use of technetium-99m, the radioisotope is administered to the patient and the escaping gamma rays are incident upon a moving [[gamma camera]] which computes and processes the image. To acquire SPECT images, the gamma camera is rotated around the patient. Projections are acquired at defined points during the rotation, typically every three to six degrees. In most cases, a full 360° rotation is used to obtain an optimal reconstruction. The time taken to obtain each projection is also variable, but 15–20 seconds are typical. This gives a total scan time of 15–20 minutes.

The technetium-99m radioisotope is used predominantly in bone and brain scans. For [[bone scan]]s, the pertechnetate ion is used directly, as it is taken up by osteoblasts attempting to heal a skeletal injury, or (in some cases) as a reaction of these cells to a tumor (either primary or metastatic) in the bone. In brain scanning, Tc-99m is attached to the chelating agent HMPAO to create [[Technetium (99mTc) exametazime|technetium (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) exametazime]], an agent which localizes in the brain according to region blood flow, making it useful for the detection of stroke and dementing illnesses that decrease regional brain flow and metabolism.

Most recently, technetium-99m scintigraphy has been combined with CT coregistration technology to produce [[SPECT/CT]] scans. These employ the same radioligands and have the same uses as SPECT scanning, but are able to provide even finer 3-D localization of high-uptake tissues, in cases where finer resolution is needed. An example is the [[sestamibi parathyroid scan]] which is performed using the Tc-99m radioligand [[sestamibi]], and can be done in either SPECT or SPECT/CT machines.

===Bone scan===
The [[nuclear medicine]] technique commonly called the [[bone scan]] usually uses Tc-99m. It is not to be confused with the "bone density scan", [[DEXA]], which is a low-exposure X-ray test measuring bone density to look for osteoporosis and other diseases where bones lose mass without rebuilding activity. The nuclear medicine technique is sensitive to areas of unusual bone rebuilding activity, since the radiopharmaceutical is taken up by [[osteoblast]] cells which build bone. The technique therefore is sensitive to fractures and bone reaction to bone tumors, including metastases. For a bone scan, the patient is injected with a small amount of radioactive material, such as {{convert|700|-|1100|MBq|mCi|abbr=on}} of [[technetium (99mTc) medronic acid|<sup>99m</sup>Tc-medronic acid]] and then scanned with a [[gamma camera]]. Medronic acid is a [[phosphate]] derivative which can exchange places with bone phosphate in regions of active bone growth, so anchoring the radioisotope to that specific region. To view small lesions (less than {{convert|1|cm}}) especially in the spine, the [[SPECT]] imaging technique may be required, but currently in the United States, most insurance companies require separate authorization for SPECT imaging.

===Myocardial perfusion imaging===
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a form of functional cardiac imaging, used for the diagnosis of [[ischemic heart disease]]. The underlying principle is, under conditions of stress, diseased [[myocardium]] receives less blood flow than normal myocardium. MPI is one of several types of [[cardiac stress test]]. As a [[nuclear stress test]] the average radiation exposure is 9.4 mSV which compared to a typical 2 view Chest X-Ray (.1 mSV) is equivalent to 94 Chest X-Rays.<ref name=xrayrisk.com>http://www.xrayrisk.com/calculator/calculator-normal-studies.php</ref>

Several radiopharmaceuticals and radionuclides may be used for this, each giving different information. In the myocardial perfusion scans using Tc-99m, the radiopharmaceuticals <sup>99m</sup>Tc-[[tetrofosmin]] (Myoview, [[GE Healthcare]]) or <sup>99m</sup>Tc-[[sestamibi]] (Cardiolite, [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]) are used. Following this, myocardial stress is induced, either by exercise or pharmacologically with [[adenosine]], [[dobutamine]] or [[dipyridamole]](Persantine), which increase the heart rate or by [[regadenoson]](Lexiscan), a vasodilator. ([[Aminophylline]] can be used to reverse the effects of dipyridamole and regadenoson). Scanning may then be performed with a conventional gamma camera, or with SPECT/CT.

===Cardiac ventriculography===
In [[cardiac ventriculography]], a radionuclide, usually <sup>99m</sup>Tc, is injected, and the heart is imaged to evaluate the flow through it, to evaluate [[coronary artery disease]], [[valvular heart disease]], [[congenital heart disease]]s, [[cardiomyopathy]], and other [[cardiac disorder]]s.As a [[nuclear stress test]] the average radiation exposure is 9.4 mSV which compared to a typical 2 view Chest X-Ray (.1 mSV) is equivalent to 94 Chest X-Rays.<ref name="xrayrisk.com"/><ref name=merck/> It exposes patients to less radiation than to comparable [[chest X-ray]] studies.<ref name=merck>[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec07/ch070/ch070i.html Merck manuals &gt; Radionuclide Imaging] Last full review/revision May 2009 by Michael J. Shea, MD. Content last modified May 2009</ref>

===Functional brain imaging===
Usually the gamma-emitting tracer used in functional brain imaging is <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMPAO (hexamethylpropylene amine oxime, [[Technetium (99mTc) exametazime|exametazime]]). The similar <sup>99m</sup>Tc-EC tracer may also be used. These molecules are preferentially distributed to regions of high brain blood flow, and act to assess brain metabolism regionally, in an attempt to diagnose and differentiate the different causal pathologies of [[dementia]]. When used with the 3-D [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] technique, they compete with brain [[Positron emission tomography|FDG-PET]] scans and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] brain scans as techniques to map the regional metabolic rate of brain tissue.

===Sentinel-node identification===
The radioactive properties of <sup>99m</sup>Tc can be used to identify the predominant [[lymph nodes]] draining a cancer, such as [[breast cancer]] or [[malignant melanoma]]. This is usually performed at the time of [[biopsy]] or [[Segmental resection|resection]].<sup>99m</sup>Tc-labelled [[isosulfan blue]] [[dye]] is injected intradermally around the intended biopsy site. The general location of the sentinel node is determined with the use of a handheld scanner with a gamma-sensor probe that detects the technetium-99m–labeled sulfur colloid that was previously injected around the biopsy site. An incision is then made over the area of highest radionuclide accumulation, and the sentinel node is identified within the incision by inspection; the isosulfan blue dye will usually stain any draining nodes blue.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1056/NEJMct1002967| issn = 0028-4793

===Immunoscintigraphy===
[[Immunoscintigraphy]] incorporates <sup>99m</sup>Tc into a [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]], an [[immune system]] [[protein]], capable of binding to [[cancer]] cells. A few hours after injection, medical equipment is used to detect the gamma rays emitted by the <sup>99m</sup>Tc; higher concentrations indicate where the tumor is. This technique is particularly useful for detecting hard-to-find cancers, such as those affecting the [[intestine]]s. These modified antibodies are sold by the German company [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] (now part of [[Sanofi-Aventis]]) under the name "Scintium".<ref name=blocks>{{harvnb|Emsley |2001| pp =422–425}}</ref>
