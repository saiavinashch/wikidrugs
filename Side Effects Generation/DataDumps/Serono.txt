'''Serono''' was a [[biotechnology]] [[company (law)|company]] headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. It was acquired by the German pharmaceutical company [[Merck Group|Merck]] in 2006. The company was founded as the Serono Pharmacological Institute by Cesare Serono in 1906 in [[Italy]].  A key step in its development was the discovery of a method of extracting urinary [[gonadotropin]]s by Dr Piero Donini. Serono was incorporated in 1987 and the holding company, Ares-Serono S.A., changed its name to Serono S.A. in May 2000.

Serono as a stand-alone company develops and markets [[pharmaceutical]]s in the fields of [[Wiktionary:Reproductive health|Reproductive Health]], [[Multiple Sclerosis]], Growth & [[Metabolism]] and [[Dermatology]]. It holds an estimated market share of 60%,{{cn|date=February 2017}} making it the third largest biotechnology company in the world. Serono's most important product accounted for 31.6% of the company's sales in 2004.

The eight biotechnology products are available in four core therapeutic areas: [[neurology]] for the treatment of relapsing forms of [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Wiktionary:Reproductive health|reproductive health]] for treatments of [[infertility]], [[dermatology]], where Serono has launched  biologics in Europe for moderate-to-severe [[psoriasis]], and
growth and [[metabolism]]  for treatments for HIV-associated wasting and growth deficiencies.

The Company also conducts research in [[oncology]] and [[autoimmune diseases]]. Through the acquisition in 1997 of GBRI from GlaxoWelcome, becoming its Geneva based research institute named SPRI, and the [[Manteia Predictive Medicine]] spin-off, Serono also nursed the emergence of now a commercial leading [[massive parallel sequencing]] technology.

==Sale to Merck KGaA==

36% of Serono was sold to [[Merck KGaA]] in Sept. 2006 for € 10,6 Billion; [[Merck KGaA]] paid CHF 1,100 for each share. The new entity, which merges Serono with Merck's Ethicals division, is called [[Merck-Serono|Merck Serono]]. Its headquarters was in Geneva, within the new Serono facilities. The US operations remain near Boston. The process of merging started in January 2007 after various business regulatory reviews and phases were complete. Until that time, Serono and Merck KGaA operated as separate entities. The new, combined entity,  [[Merck Serono]] is the size of other large biotechs. In 2011, a decision was made to close the Geneva headquarters and move the headquarters to Darmstadt, Germany resulting in job losses to most of the employees in Geneva.

==Facilities==
Serono operated in 44 countries, with manufacturing  facilities in eight countries and sales in over 90 countries. Main manufacturing sites were in Switzerland, Italy, Spain and France; a fifth facility in Israel was closed in 2004 owing to its obsolescence. Research and development facilities were maintained in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston, USA]], and [[Ivrea]], Italy. It employed over 4,750 people with worldwide revenues of USD 2,586.4 million (2005). It had eight biotechnology products on the market, and more than 25 ongoing preclinical and clinical development projects at the end of 2005.
Serono Headquarters and the Geneva research site moved to a brand new campus (Horizon Secheron) in the heart of Geneva in 2006. This facility and the Headquarters were closed by Merck KGaA in 2013. The building was sold back to Berterelli family.

==Lawsuit==

In 2005, Serono agreed to a $704 million settlement with the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to resolve civil and criminal allegations that the company engaged in a fraudulent scheme to promote the drug [[Serostim]] for [[off-label use]]s and paid out illegal kickbacks for prescribing the drug in violation of the [[False Claims Act]].<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2005/October/05_civ_545.html #05-545: 10-17-05 SERONO TO PAY $704 MILLION FOR THE ILLEGAL MARKETING OF AIDS DRUG] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102113937/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2005/October/05_civ_545.html |date=November 2, 2013 }}</ref> The settlement is, to date, the [[List of Largest Pharmaceutical Settlements|sixth largest pharmaceutical settlement]] in U.S. history.
