'''Natalizumab''' is a [[humanized antibody|humanized]] [[monoclonal antibody]] against the [[cell adhesion molecule]] [[integrin|α4-integrin]]. Natalizumab is used in the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Crohn's disease]]. It is co-marketed by [[Biogen]] and [[Élan]] as '''Tysabri''', and was previously named '''Antegren'''. Natalizumab is administered by [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous infusion]] every 28 days.  The drug is believed to work by reducing the ability of [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[Immune system|immune cells]] to attach to and pass through the cell layers lining the [[intestine]]s and [[blood–brain barrier]].  Natalizumab has proven effective in treating the symptoms of both diseases, preventing relapse, vision loss, cognitive decline and significantly improving [[quality of life]] in people with multiple sclerosis, as well as increasing rates of remission and preventing relapse in Crohn's disease.

Natalizumab was approved in 2004 by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). It was subsequently [[list of withdrawn drugs|withdrawn from the market]] by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare neurological condition [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML) when administered in combination with [[interferon beta-1a]], another [[immunosuppressive drug]] often used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  After a review of safety information and no further deaths, the drug was returned to the US market in 2006 under a special prescription program. As of June 2009, ten cases of PML were known. However, twenty-four cases of PML had been reported since its reintroduction by October 2009, showing a sharp rise in the number of fatalities and prompting a review of the chemical for human use by the [[European Medicines Agency]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/press/pr/67119009en.pdf | format = pdf | title = Meeting highlights from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use | accessdate = 2010-08-31  | publisher = [[European Medicines Agency]] | date = 2009-10-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSLT39797520091029 | date = 2009-10-29| accessdate = 2010-08-31  | agency = [[Reuters]] | title = EU agency reports 24th case of Tysabri infection  | last = Hirschler | first = B |author2=Cowell D }}</ref><ref name=June2009>{{cite news |title=Biogen reports 10th case of PML brain infection |agency= [[Reuters]] |vauthors=Clarke T, Orlofsky S, Von Ahn L |date=2009-06-29 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE55S39X20090629 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 }}</ref> By January 2010, 31 cases of PML were attributed to natalizumab.<ref name = Medscape>{{cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/716536 | title = PML Risk Increases With Repeated Natalizumab Infusions: FDA | last = Jeffrey | first = S | date = 2010-02-05 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | publisher = [[Medscape]] }}</ref>  The FDA did not withdraw the drug from the market because its clinical benefits outweigh the risks involved.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/news/20080801/ms-drug-tysabri-tied-to-brain-infection | title = MS Drug Tysabri Tied to Brain Infection | publisher = [[WebMD]] | last = Hitti | first = M | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | date = 2008-08-01 }}</ref> In the [[European Union]], it has been approved for human use only for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and only then as a monotherapy because the initial cases of PML, and later the fatalities, were said by the manufacturers to be linked to the use of previous medicines by the patients.

Natalizumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in people with multiple sclerosis. The studies enrolled individuals with MS who experienced at least one clinical relapse during the prior year and had a Kurtzke [[Expanded Disability Status Scale|EDSS]] score between 0 and 5.  In these trials natalizumab was shown to reduce relapses in individuals with MS by 68% vs. [[placebo]], a margin far greater than had been seen for other approved MS therapies.<ref name = Polman>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Polman CH, O'Connor PW, Havrdova E, etal |title=A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of natalizumab for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis |journal=[[N.

[[Image:AntibodyChains.svg|thumb|200px|Structure of a generic [[antibody]]]]
Natalizumab is a  [[humanized antibody|humanized]] [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] against alpha-4 (α4) [[integrin]], the first drug developed in the class of selective adhesion molecule inhibitors. α4-integrin is required for [[white blood cell]]s to move into [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and natalizumab's [[mechanism of action]] is believed to be the prevention of immune cells from crossing blood vessel walls to reach affected organs.<ref name=Rice2005>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rice GP, Hartung HP, Calabresi PA |title=Anti-alpha4 integrin therapy for multiple sclerosis: mechanisms and rationale |journal=Neurology |volume=64 |issue=8 |pages=1336–42 |year=2005 |pmid=15851719 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000158329.30470.D0}}</ref>

=== In multiple sclerosis ===
The [[Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms|symptom]]-causing [[lesion]]s of MS are believed to be caused when [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] cells such as [[T-lymphocyte]]s pass through the [[blood–brain barrier]] through interaction with receptors on the [[endothelium|endothelial cells]].  Natalizumab appears to reduce the transmission of immune cells into the [[central nervous system]] by interfering with the [[VLA-4|α4β1-integrin receptor molecules]] on the surfaces of cells.  The effect appears to occur on endothelial cells expressing the [[VCAM-1]] gene, and in [[parenchyma]]l cells expressing the [[osteopontin]] gene.  In animals used to model MS and test therapies, repeated administration of natalizumab reduced migration of [[leukocyte]]s into the brain's parenchyma, and also reduced lesioning, though it is uncertain if this is clinically significant for humans.<ref name="Tysabri label">{{cite web|url=http://tysabri.com/en_US/tysb/footer/TYSABRI-pi.pdf |format=PDF |title=Final TYSABRI PI |accessdate=2008-03-13 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822114107/http://www.tysabri.com/en_US/tysb/footer/TYSABRI-pi.pdf |archivedate=August 22, 2007 }}</ref>

Individuals with MS dosed with natalizumab demonstrated increased [[CD34]]-expressing cells, with research suggesting a peak in expression after 72 hours.<ref name="pmid18235044">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zohren F, Toutzaris D, Klarner V, Hartung HP, Kieseier B, Haas R |title=The monoclonal anti-VLA4 antibody natalizumab mobilizes CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells in humans |journal=[[Blood (journal)|Blood]] |volume= 111|issue= 7|pages= 3893–5|year=2008 |pmid=18235044 |doi=10.1182/blood-2007-10-120329 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18235044}}</ref>

=== In Crohn's disease ===
The interaction of the α4β7 integrin and the [[addressin]] (also known as MADCAM1) endothelial cell receptor is believed to contribute to the chronic bowel inflammation that causes Crohn's disease.  Addressin is primarily expressed in the endothelium of [[venules]] in the small intestine and are critical in guiding T-lymphocytes to [[Lymphatic system|lymphatic tissues]] in [[Peyer's patches]].  In CD patients, sites of active inflammation of the bowel in CD patients have increased expression of addressin, suggesting a connection between the inflammation and the receptor.  Natalizumab may block interaction between the α4β7 integrin and addressin at sites of inflammation.  [[Animal model]]s have found higher levels of VCAM-1 expression in mice with [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and the VCAM-1 gene may also play a part in CD but its role is not yet clear.<ref name = "Tysabri label"/>

== Interactions ==
Natalizumab appears to interact with other immune-modulating drugs to increase the risk of [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML), an often-fatal [[opportunistic infection]] caused by the [[JC virus]].  In 2005, two people taking natalizumab in combination with [[interferon beta-1a]] developed PML.
