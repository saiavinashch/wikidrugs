'''Visine''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|aɪ|ˈ|z|iː|n}} is a brand of [[eye drop]]s produced by [[Johnson & Johnson]]. Johnson & Johnson acquired Visine, along with [[Pfizer]]'s entire consumer healthcare portfolio, in December 2006. In some countries it is called Vispring.

==Visine Original<!--brand name should remain capitalized-->==
The active ingredients in the original Visine formulation are [[potassium chloride]] and [[tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride]] which is a [[vasoconstrictor]], and therefore constricts the [[human eye|eye]]'s superficial [[blood vessels]].

===Administration===

Visine is administered topically with 1 to 2 drops applied to the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily [http://www.pfizerch.com/product.aspx?id=330].

===Adverse effects===

*Those using Visine Original frequently report stinging and burning upon application.<ref name="Skilling">{{cite journal | last1 = Skilling Jr | first1 = FC | last2 = Weaver | first2 = TA | last3 = Kato | first3 = KP | last4 = Ford | first4 = JG | last5 = Dussia | first5 = EM | title = Effects of two eye drop products on computer users with subjective ocular discomfort | journal = Optometry (St. Louis, Mo.) | volume = 76 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–54 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15682562 | doi=10.1016/s1529-1839(05)70254-2}}</ref>
*Use of this product can cause a rebound effect causing the redness to worsen. Prolonged use can cause blood vessels to be dilated for an extended period of time. Use should be limited unless specified by a doctor.{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}
*A red eye may often be indicative of more serious underlying ocular condition; simply reducing blood flow to the area won't solve the condition and may even exacerbate symptoms.
*These drops are also not advised for contact lens wearers because decreased blood flow to the surface of the eye will further lower the levels of oxygen available to the eye.{{Verify source|date=December 2007}}
*Visine is not to be used by patients with [[glaucoma]] since the production of more liquids only contributes to the problem of high pressure within the eye.

==Side effects==
A common [[urban legend]] is that a few drops of Visine in an unsuspecting victim's drink will cause harmless but debilitating bouts of [[explosive diarrhea]], akin to that of a [[laxative|laxative.]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/3906013-nothing-funny-about-so-called-visine-prank-says-pharmacist/|title=Nothing funny about so-called ‘Visine prank,’ says pharmacist {{!}} TheRecord.com|last=Starr|first=Katie|date=2013-07-23|work=TheRecord.com|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-CA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/3906013-nothing-funny-about-so-called-visine-prank-says-pharmacist/|title=Nothing funny about so-called ‘Visine prank,’ says pharmacist {{!}} TheRecord.com|last=Starr|first=Katie|date=2013-07-23|work=TheRecord.com|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-CA}}</ref> This will not produce explosive diarrhea, but oral administration of Visine can induce dangerous side effects related to Visine's ingredient [[tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride]] such as:

*Dangerously low body temperature ([[hypothermia]])
*Blurred vision
*[[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]] (as opposed to [[explosive diarrhea]])
*Difficulty in [[breathing]] or even a complete halt in breathing
*Elevating ([[hypertension]]) then dropping ([[hypotension]]) blood pressure
*Possible [[coma]]
*[[Seizures]] and [[tremor]]s

Anyone ingesting Visine should get medical attention or contact a [[poison control center]] immediately.<ref name="jj">{{cite web |title=Visine Original |url=http://www.visine.com/product-visine-original.jsp |publisher=Johnson & Johnson Healthcare Products Division of McNeil |quote=If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.}} &mdash; under ''Warnings''</ref>

==Popular culture==
The effect of Visine causing upset gastrointestinal effects when being ingested is depicted in the movie ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'' where John Beckwith (portrayed by [[Owen Wilson]]) poisons Sack's ([[Bradley Cooper]]) drink, causing him to suffer all night. John Beckwith also uses the Visine several times over the course of the film to fake crying. This movie has gained notoriety for encouraging the deadly prank of putting Visine eyedrops in drinking water bottles, threatening severe or fatal injury to drinkers.

The [[urban legend]] about Visine's explosive diarrhea-inducing capacity is also perpetuated in the movie version of ''[[I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell (film)|I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell]]''. In the movie, the main character [[Tucker Max]] (played by [[Matt Czuchry]]) is making fun of two women at the bar, in which one of them squirts Visine into his beer bottle. This leads to Tucker and an allegedly married woman he leaves the bar with to both have extreme explosive diarrhea.
