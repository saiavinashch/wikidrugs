'''Boudreaux's Butt Paste''' is an American brand of [[Moisturizer|skin cream]] that started out as a remedy for [[diaper rash]].<ref name=babybottonline>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Daniel|title='Butt Paste' improves baby's bottom line|url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=53164|publisher=[[WKYC]]|date=June 5, 2006|accessdate=March 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name="PtbaM">{{cite book|last=Spinks|first=Tom|title=Prepare to Be a Millionaire|year=2008|publisher=HCI|isbn=0757307140|pages=112–116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlRLXLzYjxoC&pg=PA112&dq=%22Boudreaux's+Butt+Paste%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=P_0yUdmRIcPz0gG8rIHQBQ&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Boudreaux's%20Butt%20Paste%22&f=false}}</ref> It has also been used for the treatment of various [[dermatology|skin ailments]] including [[psoriasis]], [[jock itch]], [[shingles]],  [[cold sore]]s and [[acne]].<ref name=telegraphco>{{cite web|title=No ifs and buts about this paste|last=Whitworth|first=Melissa|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/children_shealth/3311507/No-ifs-and-buts-about-this-paste.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=November 1, 2004|accessdate=March 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Sayre"/> 

The product was created in the 1970s by George Boudreaux of [[Covington, Louisiana]], while he was working as an intern pharmacist.<ref name="PtbaM" /> He continued to work on the formula after becoming a licensed pharmacist and sold it at his pharmacy, later naming it "Boudreaux's Butt Paste" after a physician told him a story about a patient who had referred to the product as such.<ref name="PtbaM" />

Boudreaux began distributing the product more extensively after he sold his pharmacy in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|title=Boudreaux's Butt Paste goes national|newspaper=The Daily Reveille|date=April 1, 2004}}</ref> Manufacturing moved from [[Alabama]] to [[New Orleans]] in 2004.<ref name="Sayre">{{cite web|last=Sayre|first=Alan|title=Butt Paste: The name says it all|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2004/aug/24/butt-paste-the-name-says-it-all/|publisher=[[Associated Press]] in [[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=August 4, 2004|accessdate=March 3, 2013}}</ref> After [[Oprah Winfrey]] recommended the product on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|her show]] the response was so great that the company's website crashed,<ref name=telegraphco/> and demand for Boudreaux's Butt Paste quadrupled.<ref name=indianaeconomicdigest/> When [[Brad Pitt]] talked of a "horrible diaper rash" in two of his children,<ref name=people-rash>{{cite news|title=Brad Pitt Needs Your Help!

In August 2005, a {{convert|14|ft|adj=on}} tide caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit the area where Boudreaux's Butt Paste was manufactured, so emergency production was moved to Indiana.<ref name=babybottonline/> Soon after, the company was sold to Blairex Industries in [[Columbus, Indiana]]. After the sale, Boudreaux continued to work in Covington to work on marketing and developing new products based upon Butt Paste. Blairex focused on manufacturing and distribution.<ref name=indianaeconomicdigest>{{cite news|last=Johannesen|first=Kirk|title=Columbus-based Blairex Laboratories grows with Boudreaux merger|url=http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.net/main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID=62&ArticleID=27155|accessdate=March 3, 2013|newspaper=[[The Republic (Columbus)|The Republic]] ''reprinted in'' Indiana Economic Digest|date=May 28, 2006}}</ref> 

On December 29, 2011, Blairex sold the brand to C.B.

In 2008, due to Boudreaux's Butt Paste ads on the car, Ray's No. 90 Ford was named the fifth scariest NASCAR paint scheme of all time by ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' for having "'BUTT PASTE' slapped on the rear quarter panels in giant red lettering and a cartoon baby riding on the hood."<ref>McGee, Ryan.
