'''Carprofen''', marketed under many brand names worldwide,<ref name=brands>Drugs.com [https://www.drugs.com/international/carprofen.html International brand names for Carprofen] Page accessed October 4, 2017</ref> is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) that [[veterinarian]]s prescribe as a supportive treatment for various conditions in animals.<ref name=label>[https://www.zoetisus.com/products/pages/rimadyldvm/docs/Rimadyl_Injectable_pi.pdf Carprofen/Rimadyl (Carprofen) prescribing instructions]</ref> It provides day-to-day treatment for pain and inflammation from various kinds of [[orthopedic|joint]] pain as well as post-operative pain.<ref name=label/>  Carprofen reduces inflammation by inhibition of [[COX-1]] and [[COX-2]]; its specificity for COX-2 varies from species to species.<ref name=label/>

==Use in dogs==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
==Adverse effects==
Most dogs respond well to carprofen use, but like all NSAIDs, it may cause gastrointestinal, liver and kidney problems in some patients.

After introduction, significant anecdotal reports of sudden animal deaths from its use arose. To date {{when|date=September 2016}}, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] has received more than 6,000 adverse reaction reports about the drug (manufactured by [[Pfizer]]). As a result, the FDA requested that Pfizer advise consumers in their advertising that death is a possible side effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/CVMUpdates/ucm129408.htm|title=Update On Rimadyl, FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, December 1, 1999}}</ref> Pfizer refused and pulled their advertising; however, they now include death as a possible side effect on the drug label. Plans call for a "Dear Doctor" letter to advise veterinarians, and a safety sheet attached to pill packages.

Adverse effects include:
* Loss of appetite
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Increase in thirst
* Increase in urination
* Fatigue and/or lethargy ([[drowsiness]])
* Loss of coordination
* Seizures
* Liver dysfunction: [[jaundice]] (yellowing of eyes)
* Blood or dark tar-like material in [[urine]] or [[faeces|stools]]
* [[Lethargy]].
* Staggering, stumbling, weakness or partial [[paralysis]], full paralysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srdogs.com/Pages/rimadyl.ade.steps.html| title=A Review of Signs of a Potentially Life-threatening Reaction to Rimadyl|date=|accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref>
* Change in [[skin]] (redness, scabs, or scratching)
* Change in behavior (such as decreased or increased activity level, [[seizure]] or aggression).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rimadyl.com/display.aspx?drug=RC&species=CN&sec=610| title=Dog Owner Information About Rimadyl (carprofen)|date=|accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref>

Effects of overdose include [[gastritis]] and ulcer formation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rimadylonline.com/| title=Generic Dog Rimadyl Online|date=|accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref> 

Carprofen should not be administered concurrently with steroids, as this can cause ulcers in the stomach. Dogs should be taken off carprofen for three full days before ingesting a steroid (such as [[prednisolone]]). Carprofen should not be given at the same time with other types of medications such as other [[NSAID]]s ([[aspirin]], [[etodolac]], [[deracoxib]], [[meloxicam]], [[tepoxalin]]) or [[steroids]] such as [[dexamethasone]], [[triamcinolone]], [[cortisone]] or [[prednisone]].

Carprofen must be used with caution within the supervision of a veterinarian in dogs with liver or kidney disease, [[dehydration]], bleeding deficits, or other health problems. It is not recommended for use in dogs with bleeding disorders (such as [[Von Willebrand's disease]]), as safety has not been established in dogs with these disorders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetdepot.com/Rimadyl-Carprofen-25mg-60-Caplets.html|title=Rimadyl   (Carprofen)|date=|accessdate=2010-05-20}}</ref> It has not been established whether carprofen can be safely used in pregnant dogs, dogs used for breeding purposes,  or in lactating female dogs.

Several laboratory studies and clinical trials have been conducted to establish the safety of using Carprofen. Clinical studies were conducted in nearly 300 dogs, coming from different [[breeds]]. The dogs were treated with Rimadyl at the recommended dose for 2 weeks. According to these studies, the drug was clinically well tolerated and the treated dogs did not have a greater incidence of adverse reactions when compared to the control group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rimadyl.com/account/DisplayPDF?docName=PI.pdf| title=Rimadyl [package insert]. New York, NY: Pfizer Animal Health, 2007.|date=|accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref>

A number of factors that may contribute to the high incidence of adverse reports received for carprofen by the Center for Veterinary Medicine in the late 1990s. These include:
* The type of drug;
* Wide use;
* Duration of use. While the side effects from carprofen are known to occur within a short period of time after administration, it is believed that long-term use may actually result in a higher risk for adverse reactions{{CN|date=January 2017}};
* Senior dog use. Older dogs are generally more prone to side effects caused by carprofen.

==Human use==
Carprofen was used in [[humans]] for almost 10 years, starting in 1988. It was used for the same conditions as in dogs, viz., joint pain and inflammation. Side effects tended to be mild, usually consisting of nausea or gastro-intestinal pain and diarrhea. Carprofen was available only by [[Prescription drug|prescription]] in 150 to 600&nbsp;mg doses. Dosage over 250&nbsp;mg was only for relieving pain after severe trauma, such as post-surgery inflammation.<ref name=EMA>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Maximum_Residue_Limits_-_Report/2009/11/WC500011412.pdf Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products: Carprofen], European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products</ref> 150&nbsp;mg doses were commonly used to relieve the pain of arthritis, while 200&nbsp;mg doses were commonly prescribed in cases of severe arthritis or severe inflammation pain.<ref name=EMA/> The drug was taken orally.  Pfizer voluntarily removed it from the market for human use on commercial grounds.<ref name=EMA/>

==Equine use==
Carprofen may be administered [[intravenous|intravenously]] to horses.<ref>McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. Proc. AAEP 2001 (47): 182-187.</ref> A single dose has been shown to reduce [[prostaglandin E2]] production and inflammatory exudate for up to 15 hours,<ref name="Lees 1994">{{cite journal|last1=Lees|first1=P|last2=McKellar|first2=Q|last3=May|first3=SA|last4=Ludwig|first4=B|title=Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of carprofen in the horse|journal=Equine veterinary journal|date=May 1994|volume=26|issue=3|pages=203-8|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1994.tb04370.x|pmid=8542839}}</ref> although there was less effect on [[eicosanoid]] production when compared to the effects produced by NSAIDs such as [[phenylbutazone]] or [[flunixin]].<ref name="Lees 1987">{{cite journal|last1=Lees|first1=P|last2=Ewins|first2=CP|last3=Taylor|first3=JB|last4=Sedgwick|first4=AD|title=Serum thromboxane in the horse and its inhibition by aspirin, phenylbutazone and flunixin|journal=The British veterinary journal|date=1987|volume=143|issue=5|pages=462-76|doi=10.1016/0007-1935(87)90024-8|pmid=3119142}}</ref> Prostaglandin E2 and inflammatory exudate are also reduced and [[leukotriene B4]] is inhibited. Carprofen can also be given orally, but intramuscular use may produce muscle damage.<ref name="McKellar 1991">{{cite journal|last1=McKellar|first1=QA|last2=Bogan|first2=JA|last3=von Fellenberg|first3=RL|last4=Ludwig|first4=B|last5=Cawley|first5=GD|title=Pharmacokinetic, biochemical and tolerance studies on carprofen in the horse.|journal=Equine veterinary journal|date=July 1991|volume=23|issue=4|pages=280-4|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1991.tb03718.x|pmid=1915228}}</ref>
