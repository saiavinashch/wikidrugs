'''Caffeine''' is a [[central nervous system]] (CNS) [[stimulant]] of the [[methylxanthine]] [[chemical classification|class]].<ref name="pmid1356551">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nehlig A, Daval JL, Debry G | title = Caffeine and the central nervous system: mechanisms of action, biochemical, metabolic and psychostimulant effects | journal = Brain Research. Brain Research Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–70 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1356551 | doi = 10.1016/0165-0173(92)90012-B }}</ref> It is the world's most widely consumed [[psychoactive drug]]. Unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. There are several known [[mechanism of action|mechanisms of action]] to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of [[adenosine]] on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the [[autonomic nervous system]].

<!--Physical and chemical properties, natural occurrence-->
Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline [[purine]], a [[methylxanthine]] [[alkaloid]], and is chemically related to the [[adenine]] and [[guanine]] bases of [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA). It is found in the seeds, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to South America and East Asia and helps to protect them against predator insects and to prevent germination of nearby seeds. The most well known source of caffeine is the [[coffee bean]], a [[misnomer]] for the seed of ''[[Coffea]]'' plants.  [[Beverages]] containing caffeine are ingested to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to improve performance. To make these drinks, caffeine is extracted by [[steeping]] the plant product in water, a process called [[infusion]]. Caffeine-containing drinks, such as [[coffee]], [[tea]], and [[cola]], are very popular; as of 2014, 85% of American adults consumed some form of caffeine daily, consuming 164mg on average.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Diane C.|last2=Knight|first2=Carol A.|last3=Hockenberry|first3=Jon|last4=Teplansky|first4=Robyn|last5=Hartman|first5=Terryl J.|title=Beverage caffeine intakes in the U.S.|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology|date=1 January 2014|volume=63|pages=136–142|doi=10.1016/j.fct.2013.10.042|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691513007175}}</ref>

<!--Toxicity-->
Caffeine is classified by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] as "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS). Toxic doses, over 10 grams per day for an adult, are much higher than typical doses of under 500 milligrams per day. A cup of coffee contains 80–175&nbsp;mg of caffeine, depending on what "bean" (seed) is used and how it is prepared (e.g. [[Drip brew|drip]], [[Coffee percolator|percolation]], or [[espresso]]). Thus it requires roughly 50–100 ordinary cups of coffee to reach a lethal dose.  However pure powdered caffeine, which is available as a [[dietary supplement]], can be lethal in tablespoon-sized amounts.

Caffeine facilitates learning in tasks in which information is presented passively; in tasks in which material is learned intentionally, caffeine has no effect. Caffeine facilitates performance in tasks involving working memory to a limited extent, but hinders performance in tasks that heavily depend on this, and caffeine appears to improve memory performance under suboptimal alertness. Most studies, however, found improvements in reaction time. The ingestion of caffeine does not seem to affect long-term memory.&nbsp;...

====Physical====
Caffeine is a proven [[ergogenic aid]] in humans.<ref name="Peripheral and central ergogenic effects" /> Caffeine improves athletic performance in [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] (especially [[endurance sports]]) and [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] conditions.<ref name="Peripheral and central ergogenic effects">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pesta DH, Angadi SS, Burtscher M, Roberts CK | title = The effects of caffeine, nicotine, ethanol, and tetrahydrocannabinol on exercise performance | journal = Nutrition & Metabolism | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 71 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24330705 | pmc = 3878772 | doi = 10.1186/1743-7075-10-71 | quote = Caffeine-induced increases in performance have been observed in aerobic as well as anaerobic sports (for reviews, see [26,30,31]). Trained athletes seem to benefit from a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg [32], however, even lower doses of caffeine (1.0–2.0 mg/kg) may improve performance [33]. Some groups found significantly improved time trial performance [34] or maximal cycling power [35], most likely related to a greater reliance on fat metabolism and decreased neuromuscular fatigue, respectively. Theophylline, a metabolite of caffeine, seems to be even more effective in doing so [36]. The effect of caffeine on fat oxidation, however, may only be significant during lower exercise intensities and may be blocked at higher intensities [37].&nbsp;... For both caffeine-naïve as well as caffeine-habituated subjects, moderate to high doses of caffeine are ergogenic during prolonged moderate intensity exercise [61].&nbsp;... In summary, caffeine, even at physiological doses (3–6 mg/kg), as well as coffee are proven ergogenic aids and as such – in most exercise situations, especially in endurance-type events – clearly work-enhancing [26]. It most likely has a peripheral effect targeting skeletal muscle metabolism as well as a central effect targeting the brain to enhance performance, especially during endurance events (see Table 1). Also for anaerobic tasks, the effect of caffeine on the CNS might be most relevant.&nbsp;... Muendel et al. [93] found a 17% improvement in time to exhaustion after nicotine patch application compared to a placebo without affecting cardiovascular and respiratory parameters or substrate metabolism. In this sense, nicotine seems to exert similar effects as caffeine by delaying the development of central fatigue as impaired central drive is an important factor contributing to fatigue during exercise.&nbsp;...

===Specific populations===

====Adults====
For the general population of healthy adults, Health Canada advises a daily intake of no more than 400&nbsp;mg.<ref name="itsyourhealth"/>

====Children====
In healthy children, caffeine intake produces effects that are "modest and typically innocuous".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0278-6915(02)00097-2| title = Effects of caffeine on development and behavior in infancy and childhood: A review of the published literature| journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology| volume = 40| issue = 9| pages = 1235–1242| year = 2002| last1 = Castellanos | first1 = F.

|-

| 62.5&nbsp;mg
|-
| 10–12
| 85&nbsp;mg (about ½ cup of coffee)
|}

====Adolescents====
[[Health Canada]] has not developed advice for adolescents because of insufficient data. However, they suggest that daily caffeine intake for this age group be no more than 2.5&nbsp;mg/kg body weight. This is because the maximum adult caffeine dose may not be appropriate for light weight adolescents or for younger adolescents who are still growing. The daily dose of 2.5&nbsp;mg/kg body weight would not cause adverse health effects in the majority of adolescent caffeine consumers. This is a conservative suggestion since older and heavier weight adolescents may be able to consume adult doses of caffeine without suffering adverse effects.<ref name="itsyourhealth"/>

==== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ====
The UK [[Food Standards Agency]] has recommended that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake, out of prudence, to less than 200&nbsp;mg of caffeine a day&nbsp;– the equivalent of two cups of instant coffee, or one and a half to two cups of fresh coffee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2008/nov/caffeineadvice|title=Food Standards Agency publishes new caffeine advice for pregnant women|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200&nbsp;mg per day in pregnant women.<ref name="ACOG policy 462 caffeine"/> For women who breastfeed, are pregnant, or may become pregnant, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 300&nbsp;mg, or a little over two 8&nbsp;oz (237&nbsp;mL) cups of coffee.<ref name="itsyourhealth"/>

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
{{Synapse map}}
[[File:Caffeine and adenosine.svg|thumb|250px|Caffeine's primary mechanism of action is as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of [[adenosine]] receptors in the brain|alt=Two skeletal formulas: left&nbsp;– caffeine, right&nbsp;– adenosine.]]

In the absence of caffeine and when a person is awake and alert, little [[adenosine]] is present in (CNS) neurons. With a continued wakeful state, over time it accumulates in the neuronal [[synapse]], in turn binding to and activating [[adenosine receptor]]s found on certain CNS neurons; when activated, these receptors produce a cellular response that ultimately increases [[drowsiness]]. When caffeine is consumed, it [[receptor antagonist|antagonizes]] adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" />

====Receptor and ion channel targets====
Caffeine is an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] at all four [[adenosine receptor]] subtypes ([[adenosine receptor A1|A<sub>1</sub>]], [[adenosine receptor A2a|A<sub>2A</sub>]], [[adenosine receptor A2b|A<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[adenosine receptor A3|A<sub>3</sub>]]), although with varying [[potency (pharmacology)|potencies]].<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" /><ref name="pmid22886028" /> The [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] ([[dissociation constant|K<sub>D</sub>]]) values of caffeine for the human adenosine receptors are 12&nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A1 receptor|A<sub>1</sub>]], 2.4&nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A2A receptor|A<sub>2A</sub>]], 13&nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A2B receptor|A<sub>2B</sub>]], and 80&nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A3 receptor|A<sub>3</sub>]].<ref name="pmid22886028">{{cite journal | vauthors = Froestl W, Muhs A, Pfeifer A | title = Cognitive enhancers (nootropics).

Because caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] that separates the bloodstream from the interior of the brain.

=====Effects on striatal dopamine=====
While caffeine does not directly bind to any [[dopamine receptor]]s, it influences the binding activity of [[dopamine]] at its receptors in the [[striatum]] by binding to adenosine receptors that have formed [[GPCR oligomer|GPCR heteromers]] with dopamine receptors, specifically the [[adenosine receptor A1|A<sub>1</sub>]]–[[DRD1|D<sub>1</sub>]] receptor [[heterodimer]] (this is a receptor complex with 1 adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor and 1 dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor) and the [[adenosine receptor A2a|A<sub>2A</sub>]]–[[DRD2|D<sub>2</sub>]] receptor [[heterotetramer]] (this is a receptor complex with 2 adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors and 2 dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors).<ref name="A1-DRD1 and A2a-DRD2 review">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferré S | title = Role of the central ascending neurotransmitter systems in the psychostimulant effects of caffeine | journal = Journal of Alzheimer's Disease | volume = 20 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = S35-49 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20182056 | doi = 10.3233/JAD-2010-1400 | quote = By targeting A1-A2A receptor heteromers in striatal glutamatergic terminals and A1 receptors in striatal dopaminergic terminals (presynaptic brake), caffeine induces glutamate-dependent and glutamate-independent release of dopamine.

====Off-target effects====
Caffeine antagonizes [[adenosine A2A receptor]]s in the [[ventrolateral preoptic area]] (VLPO), thereby reducing inhibitory [[GABA]] [[neurotransmission]] to the [[tuberomammillary nucleus]], a [[histamine]]rgic projection nucleus that activation-dependently promotes arousal.<ref name="Ferre 2008">{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ferré S | title = An update on the mechanisms of the psychostimulant effects of caffeine | journal = J.

(2007) as 'nucleus accumbens shell,' where both studies show that caffeine does not modify the extracellular levels of dopamine. Therefore, the results of both experimental groups are basically the same and point to differential effects of caffeine in different striatal subcompartments. In fact, analyzing the effects of the intrastriatal perfusion of an A1 receptor antagonist in several other striatal compartments showed striking differences compared with the shell of the nucleus accumbens. Thus, A1 receptor blockade signiﬁcantly increased the extracellular concentration of dopamine, but not glutamate, in the core of the nucleus accumbens and in the caudate–putamen and the effect was more pronounced in the most medial compartments (Boryczet al. 2007). In summary, a subregional difference in the A1 receptor-mediated control of glutamate and dopamine release exists in the striatum&nbsp;... A2A receptors play a crucial role in the sleep-promoting effects of adenosine and the arousal-enhancing effects of caffeine (Huang et al. 2007; Ferré et al. 2007a). Those A2A receptors are localized in the ventrolateral pre-optic area of the hypothalamus and their stimulation promotes sleep by inducing GABA release in the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, thereby inhibiting the histaminergic arousal system&nbsp;... chronic caffeine exposure counteracts both motor activation and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens induced by caffeine or an A1 receptor antagonist&nbsp;... An additional factor that might play a signiﬁcant role in caffeine tolerance is the signiﬁcant increase in plasma and extracellular concentrations of adenosine with chronic caffeine exposure&nbsp;... The existence of an A1 receptor-mediated glutamate-independent modulation of dopamine release suggested the presence of functional A1 receptors in striatal dopaminergic terminals.&nbsp;... In the SSM, adenosine acts pre- and post-synaptically through multiple mechanisms, which depend on heteromerization of A1 and A2A receptors among themselves and with D1 and D2 receptors, respectively. Caffeine produces its motor and reinforcing effects by releasing the pre- and post-synaptic brakes that adenosine imposes on dopaminergic neurotransmission in the SSM. By releasing the pre-synaptic brake, caffeine induces glutamate-dependent and glutamate-independent release of dopamine.}}</ref> Disinhibition of the tuberomammillary nucleus is the chief mechanism by which caffeine produces wakefulness-promoting effects.<ref name="Ferre 2008" />

[[Benzene]], [[chloroform]], [[trichloroethylene]], and [[dichloromethane]] have all been used over the years but for reasons of safety, environmental impact, cost, and flavor, they have been superseded by the following main methods:
* '''Water extraction:''' Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains many other compounds in addition to caffeine and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]], which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor. Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter caffeine tablets.<ref name="Decaffeination">{{cite web|author=Senese F |title=How is coffee decaffeinated? |publisher=General Chemistry Online |date=20 September 2005 |url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/consumer/faq/decaffeinating-coffee.shtml |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>
* '''Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction:''' [[Supercritical carbon dioxide]] is an excellent nonpolar [[solvent]] for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: {{CO2}} is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1&nbsp;°C and pressures above 73 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]. Under these conditions, {{CO2}} is in a "[[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]]" [[Phase (matter)|state]]: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97–99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden {{CO2}} is then sprayed with high pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by [[Activated carbon|charcoal]] [[adsorption]] (as above) or by [[distillation]], [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], or [[reverse osmosis]].<ref name="Decaffeination" />
* '''Extraction by organic solvents:''' Certain organic solvents such as [[ethyl acetate]] present much less health and environmental hazard than chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents used formerly. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds.<ref name=Decaffeination/>

"Decaffeinated" coffees do in fact contain caffeine in many cases&nbsp;– some commercially available decaffeinated coffee products contain considerable levels. One study found that decaffeinated coffee contained 10&nbsp;mg of caffeine per cup, compared to approximately 85&nbsp;mg of caffeine per cup for regular coffee.<ref name="pmid17132260">{{cite journal | vauthors = McCusker RR, Fuehrlein B, Goldberger BA, Gold MS, Cone EJ | title = Caffeine content of decaffeinated coffee | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 611–3 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17132260 | doi = 10.1093/jat/30.8.611 | laysummary = http://news.ufl.edu/2006/10/10/decaf/ | laysource = University of Florida News }}</ref>

===Detection in body fluids===
Caffeine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually in the range of 2–10&nbsp;mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36&nbsp;mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400&nbsp;mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15&nbsp;mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors= Baselt R |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=11th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Seal Beach, CA |year=2017 |pages=335–8 |isbn=978-0-692-77499-1}}</ref>

===Analogs===
Some analog substances have been created which mimic caffeine's properties with either function or structure or both.

Around sixty plant species are known to contain caffeine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/780334|title=Which Plants Contain Caffeine?
|work=medscape.com}}</ref> Common sources are the "beans" (seeds) of the two cultivated coffee plants, ''[[Coffea arabica]]'' and ''[[Coffea canephora|C. canephora]]'' (the quantity varies, but 1.3% is a typical value<ref>For more information, see {{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Coffee and Caffeine|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/caffeine-faq/|author=Alejandro Lopez-Ortiz}}</ref>); in the leaves of the [[camellia sinensis|tea bush]]; and in [[kola nut]]s. Other sources include [[Ilex vomitoria|yaupon holly]] leaves, South American holly [[yerba mate]] leaves, seeds from Amazonian maple [[guarana]] berries, and Amazonian holly [[Ilex guayusa|guayusa]] leaves.

The differing perceptions in the effects of ingesting beverages made from various plants containing caffeine could be explained by the fact that these beverages also contain  varying mixtures of other [[methylxanthine]] [[alkaloid]]s, including the [[cardiac]] stimulants [[theophylline]] and [[theobromine]], and polyphenols that can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.<ref name="Ref-1">{{cite book | last1 = Balentine | first1 = D.

===Beverages===

====Coffee====
The world's primary source of caffeine is the coffee "bean" (the seed of the [[coffea|coffee plant]]), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of [[coffee bean]] and the method of preparation used;<ref name="ICO">{{cite web|title=Caffeine |publisher=International Coffee Organization |url=http://www.ico.org/caffeine.asp |accessdate=1 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327113321/http://www.ico.org/caffeine.asp |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df= }}</ref> even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety [[espresso]], to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of [[drip coffee]].<ref name="caffaq_roast">{{cite web|title=Coffee and Caffeine FAQ: Does dark roast coffee have less caffeine than light roast? |url=http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/15 |accessdate=2 August 2009}}</ref><ref name="jeremiahspick">{{cite web|title=All About Coffee: Caffeine Level |publisher=Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Co |url=http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318102343/http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html |archivedate=18 March 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> ''[[coffea arabica|Arabica]]'' coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the ''[[coffea canephora|robusta]]'' variety.<ref name="ICO" />
In general, dark-roast coffee has very slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces caffeine content of the bean by a small amount.<ref name="caffaq_roast" /><ref name="jeremiahspick" />

====Tea====
Tea contains more caffeine than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since tea is normally brewed more weakly than coffee. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, teas contain varying amounts of caffeine.<ref name="FRI">{{cite journal|vauthors=Hicks MB, Hsieh YH, Bell LN |title=Tea preparation and its influence on methylxanthine concentration |journal=Food Research International |year=1996 |volume=29 |pages=325–330 |doi=10.1016/0963-9969(96)00038-5 |issue=3–4}}</ref>

Tea contains small amounts of [[theobromine]] and slightly higher levels of [[theophylline]] than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a very poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese [[green tea]], ''[[gyokuro]]'', for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like ''[[lapsang souchong]]'', which has very little.<ref name="FRI" />

====Soft drinks and energy drinks====
Caffeine is also a common ingredient of [[soft drink]]s, such as [[cola]], originally prepared from [[kola nut]]s. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce serving.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nutrition and healthy eating|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372?pg=2|website=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=18 November 2015}}</ref> By contrast, [[energy drink]]s, such as [[Red Bull]], can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of [[decaffeination]] or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring [[slow-release]] [[excipient]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Bempong DK, Houghton PJ, Steadman K |year=1993 |title=The xanthine content of guarana and its preparations |journal=Int J Pharmacog |issn=0925-1618 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=175–181 |doi=10.3109/13880209309082937}}</ref>

====Other beverages====
* [[Mate (beverage)|Mate]] is a drink popular in many parts of South America. Its preparation consists of filling a gourd with the leaves of the South American holly [[yerba mate]], pouring hot but not boiling water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the bombilla, which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  
* [[Guaraná]] seeds ("beans") are used in making the commercially sold beverage [[Guaraná Antarctica]], which originated in Brazil and is currently the fifteenth most popular soft drink in the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* The leaves of ''[[Ilex guayusa]]'', the Ecuadorian holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a guayusa tea, which is both brewed locally and sold commercially throughout the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Chocolate===
[[Chocolate]] derived from cocoa beans contains a small amount of caffeine. The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine.<ref name="pmid15549276">{{cite journal | vauthors = Smit HJ, Gaffan EA, Rogers PJ | title = Methylxanthines are the psycho-pharmacologically active constituents of chocolate | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 176 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 412–9 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15549276 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-004-1898-3 }}</ref> A typical 28-gram serving of a milk [[chocolate bar]] has about as much caffeine as a cup of decaffeinated coffee. By weight, [[dark chocolate]] has one to two times the amount of caffeine as coffee: 80–160&nbsp;mg per 100&nbsp;g. Higher percentages of cocoa such as 90% amount to 200mg per 100g approximately and thus, a 100 gram 85% cocoa chocolate bar contains about 195mg caffeine.<ref name=Erowid/>

===Tablets===
[[File:No-Doz.jpg|thumb|right|No-Doz 100 mg caffeine tablets]]
Tablets offer the advantages over coffee and tea of convenience, known dosage, and avoiding concomitant sugar, acid and fluid intake. Manufacturers of caffeine tablets claim that using caffeine of pharmaceutical quality improves mental alertness.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  These tablets are commonly used by students studying for their exams and by people who work or drive for long hours.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YdpL2YCGLVYC&pg=PA195 |page=195 |title=The World of caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug | first1 = Bennett Alan | last1 = Weinberg | first2 = Bonnie K. | last2 = Bealer | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-92723-9 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>

===Inhalants===
There are several products being marketed that offer inhalers that deliver proprietary blends of supplements, with caffeine being a key ingredient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eagle.energy/pages/faq#|title=Some Common Questions|website=Eagle Energy|access-date=2017-05-22}}</ref> In 2012, the FDA sent a warning letter to one of the companies marketing these inhalers, expressing concerns for the lack of safety information available about inhaled caffeine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2012/ucm294774.htm|title=2012 - Breathable Foods, Inc. 3/5/12|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}</ref>

===Combinations with other drugs===
* Some beverages combine [[ethanol|alcohol]] with caffeine to create a [[caffeinated alcoholic drink]].  The stimulant effects of caffeine may mask the [[depressant]] effects of alcohol, potentially reducing the user's awareness of their level of [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]].  Such beverages have been the subject of [[Ban on caffeinated alcoholic beverages|bans]] due to safety concerns.  In particular, [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] has classified caffeine added to malt liquor beverages as an "unsafe food additive".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm190366.htm|title=Food Additives & Ingredients > Caffeinated Alcoholic Beverages|date=17 November 2010|website=fda.gov|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref>
* [[Ya ba]] contains a combination of [[methamphetamine]] and caffeine.

[[Kola nut]] use appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many [[West Africa]]n cultures, individually or in a social setting, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs.

The earliest evidence of [[cocoa bean]] use comes from residue found in an [[Maya civilization|ancient Mayan]] pot dated to 600 BCE. Also, [[chocolate]] was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called ''xocolatl'', often seasoned with [[vanilla]], [[chile pepper]], and [[achiote]]. ''Xocolatl'' was believed to fight fatigue, a belief probably attributable to the theobromine and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], and cocoa beans were often used as currency.{{citation needed |date=October 2011}}

''Xocolatl'' was introduced to [[Europe]] by the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], and became a popular beverage by 1700. The Spaniards also introduced the [[Theobroma cacao|cacao tree]] into the [[West Indies]] and the [[Philippines]]. It was used in [[alchemy|alchemical]] processes, where it was known as "black bean".{{citation needed |date=October 2011}}

The leaves and stems of the yaupon holly (''[[Ilex vomitoria]]'') were used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] to brew a [[tea]] called ''asi'' or the "[[black drink]]".<ref name=Fairbanks>{{cite book| last1 = Fairbanks | first1 = Charles H. | name-list-format = vanc | editorlink = Charles M.

===Chemical identification, isolation, and synthesis===

In 1819, the German chemist [[Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge]] isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first time; he called it ''"Kaffebase"'' (i.e. a [[base (chemistry)|base]] that exists in coffee).<ref>{{cite book|last=Runge |first=Friedlieb Ferdinand | name-list-format = vanc |title=Neueste phytochemische Entdeckungen zur Begründung einer wissenschaftlichen Phytochemie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLg5AAAAcAAJ&pg=P146 |year=1820 |publisher=G. Reimer |location=Berlin |pages=144–159 |trans_title=Latest phytochemical discoveries for the founding of a scientific phytochemistry |accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> According to Runge, he did this at the behest of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref>In 1819, Runge was invited to show Goethe how belladonna caused dilation of the pupil, which Runge did, using a cat as an experimental subject.  Goethe was so impressed with the demonstration that:  ''"Nachdem Goethe mir seine größte Zufriedenheit sowol über die Erzählung des durch scheinbaren schwarzen Staar Geretteten, wie auch über das andere ausgesprochen, übergab er mir noch eine Schachtel mit Kaffeebohnen, die ein Grieche ihm als etwas Vorzügliches gesandt. "Auch diese können Sie zu Ihren Untersuchungen brauchen," sagte Goethe.  Er hatte recht; denn bald darauf entdeckte ich darin das, wegen seines großen Stickstoffgehaltes so berühmt gewordene Coffein."''  (After Goethe had expressed to me his greatest satisfaction regarding the account of the man [whom I'd] rescued [from serving in Napoleon's army] by apparent "black star" [i.e., amaurosis, blindness] as well as the other, he handed me a carton of coffee beans, which a Greek had sent him as a delicacy.  "You can also use these in your investigations," said Goethe.  He was right; for soon thereafter I discovered therein caffeine, which became so famous on account of its high nitrogen content.)<br>
This account appeared in Runge's book ''Hauswirtschaftlichen Briefen'' (Domestic Letters [i.e., personal correspondence]) of 1866.  It was reprinted in:  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe with F.W. von Biedermann, ed., ''Goethes Gespräche'', vol. 10:  ''Nachträge, 1755–1832'' (Leipzig, (Germany):  F.W. v.

Furthermore, Berzelius stated that the French chemists had made their discoveries independently of any knowledge of Runge's or each other's work.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1825 |title=Jahres-Bericht über die Fortschritte der physischen Wissenschaften von Jacob Berzelius |volume=4 |page=180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XJI8AAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA180 |language=German |trans_title=Annual report on the progress of the physical sciences by Jacob Berzelius |last=Berzelius |first=Jöns Jakob}}  From page 180:  ''"Caféin ist eine Materie im Kaffee, die zu gleicher Zeit, 1821, von Robiquet und Pelletier und Caventou entdekt wurde, von denen aber keine etwas darüber im Drucke bekannt machte."''

(However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his ''Phytochemical Discoveries'', 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name ''Caffeebase'' a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris.)</ref> "However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his ''Phytochemical Discoveries'', 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name ''Caffeebase'' a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris."

Pelletier's article on caffeine was the first to use the term in print (in the French form ''Caféine'' from the French word for coffee: ''café'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Pelletier |first=Pierre Joseph |authorlink=Pierre Joseph Pelletier |encyclopedia=Dictionnaire de Médecine |title=Cafeine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFw_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA35 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |language=French |year=1822 |publisher=Béchet Jeune |volume=4 |location=Paris |pages=35–36}}</ref> It corroborates Berzelius's account:

In 1895, German chemist [[Hermann Emil Fischer]] (1852–1919) first synthesized caffeine from its chemical components (i.e. a "[[total synthesis]]"), and two years later, he also derived the structural formula of the compound.<ref>Fischer began his studies of caffeine in 1881; however, understanding of the molecule's structure long eluded him.  In 1895 he synthesized caffeine, but only in 1897 did he finally fully determine its molecular structure.

However, there is no regulatory provision for mandatory quantitative labeling of caffeine, (e.g., milligrams caffeine per stated serving size). There are a number of food ingredients that naturally contain caffeine. These ingredients must appear in food ingredient lists. However, as is the case for "food additive caffeine", there is no requirement to identify the quantitative amount of caffeine in composite foods containing ingredients that are natural sources of caffeine. While coffee or chocolate are broadly recognized as caffeine sources, some ingredients (e.g. [[guarana]], [[yerba maté]]) are likely less recognized as caffeine sources. For these natural sources of caffeine, there is no regulatory provision requiring that a food label identify the presence of caffeine nor state the amount of caffeine present in the food.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reissig CJ, Strain EC, Griffiths RR | title = Caffeinated energy drinks—a growing problem | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = 99 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 1–10 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18809264 | pmc = 2735818 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.08.001 | laydate = 25 September 2008 | laysummary = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080924075307.htm | laysource = ScienceDaily }}</ref>

[[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] generally also abstain from caffeine, because they believe it clouds the mind and over-stimulates the senses.
