<!-- Definition and uses -->
'''Pioglitazone''' (brand name '''Actos''') is a prescription drug of the [[thiazolidinedione]] (TZD) class with [[Anti-diabetic drug|hypoglycemic]] (antihyperglycemic, antidiabetic) action to treat [[diabetes]]. While pioglitazone does decrease blood sugar levels, studies on the main cardiovascular outcomes have not yielded statistically significant results.<ref name="Scheen2012"/>

<!-- Side effects -->
Its cardiovascular safety profile compares favorably with that of  [[rosiglitazone]], which was withdrawn from some markets after concerns about an increased risk of cardiac events. Pioglitazone has been found to be associated with bladder tumors.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Commissioner|first1=Office of the|title=Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products - Pioglitazone-containing Medicines: Drug Safety Communication - Updated FDA Review, Increased Risk of Bladder Cancer|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm532772.htm|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=14 December 2016|language=en}}</ref> It has been withdrawn in some countries.

<!-- History, society, and culture -->
Actos was the tenth-best selling drug in the U.S. in 2008, with sales exceeding $2.4 billion.<ref>[http://drugpatentwatch.com/ultimate/preview/tradename/index.php?query=ACTOS Details for Actos].</ref> 

==Medical uses==
Pioglitazone is used to lower blood glucose levels in the treatment of [[diabetes mellitus type 2]] (T2DM) either alone or in combination with a [[sulfonylurea]], [[metformin]], or [[insulin]].<ref name=Label2013>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021073s046lbl.pdf Actos Label].

Pioglitazone has also been used to treat [[non-alcoholic steatohepatitis]] (fatty liver), but this use is presently considered experimental.<ref name="pmid17135584">{{Cite journal | last1 = Belfort | first1 = R | last2 = Harrison | first2 = SA | last3 = Brown | first3 = K | last4 = Darland | first4 = C | last5 = Finch | first5 = J | last6 = Hardies | first6 = J | last7 = Balas | first7 = B | last8 = Gastaldelli | first8 = A | last9 = Tio | first9 = F | displayauthors=8 | title = A placebo-controlled trial of pioglitazone in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine|N.

==Contraindications==
Pioglitazone cannot be used in patients with a known [[hypersensitivity]] to pioglitazone, other [[thiazolidinedione]]s or any of components of its [[pharmaceutical]] forms. It is ineffective and possibly harmful in [[diabetes mellitus type 1]] and [[diabetic ketoacidosis]].<ref name="contraindications">{{cite web |url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=22567#_CONTRAINDICATIONS |title=ACTOS (pioglitazone hydrochloride) tablet |author=U.S. National Library of Medicine |year=2010 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref> Its safety in pregnancy, [[lactation]] (breastfeeding) and people under 18 is not established.

Given previous experiences with the related drug [[troglitazone]], acute diseases of the liver are regarded as a [[contraindication]] for pioglitazone.

Pioglitazone and all other drugs of its class (thiazolidinediones) are absolutely contraindicated in patients with [[heart failure]].<ref name="contraindications"/>

==Side effects==
A press release by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2007 noted that there is a greater incidence of fractures of the upper arms, hands and feet in female diabetics given [[rosiglitazone]] compared with those given metformin or glyburide. The information was based on data from the ADOPT trial. Following release of this statement, [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company]], the developer of pioglitazone (sold as Actos in many markets) admitted that it has similar implications for female patients.<ref name='Takeda, 2007'>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/UCM153896.pdf | title = Observation of an Increased Incidence of Fractures in Female Patients Who Received Long-Term Treatment with ACTOSO (pioglitazone HOI) Tablets for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus | accessdate = 2012-04-04 | last = Takeda | date = March 2007 | format = PDF}}</ref>

The risk of [[hypoglycemia]] is low in the absence of other drugs that lower blood glucose.

Pioglitazone can cause [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]] and peripheral [[edema]]. As a result, it may precipitate [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] (which worsens with fluid overload in those at risk). It may cause [[anemia]]. Mild weight gain is common due to increase in subcutaneous [[adipose tissue]]. In studies, patients on pioglitazone had an increased proportion of upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, headache, myalgia and tooth problems.

Chronic administration of the drug has led to occasional instances of [[cholestatic hepatitis]], reversible upon drug discontinuation.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1271-1272.</ref>

On July 30, 2007 an Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration concluded that the use of rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes was associated with a greater risk of "myocardial ischemic events" when compared to placebo, but when compared to other diabetes drugs, there was no increased risk. Pioglitazone is currently being reviewed. A [[meta-analysis]] released subsequently showed that pioglitazone reduced the risk of ischemic cardiac events rather than increased the risk, but increased [[Heart failure|CHF]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Pioglitazone and risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized trials |journal=JAMA |volume=298 |issue=10 |pages=1180–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17848652 |doi=10.1001/jama.298.10.1180 |author1=Lincoff AM |author2=Wolski K |author3=Nicholls SJ |author4=Nissen SE |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>

===Bladder cancer===
On June 9, 2011 the [[French Agency for the Safety of Health Products]] decided to withdraw pioglitazone in regards to high risk of [[bladder cancer]].<ref>http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2011/06/09/97001-20110609FILWWW00505-info-le-figaro-lantidiabetique-actos-retire-du-marche.php.</ref> This suspension was based on the results of an epidemiological study conducted by the French National Health Insurance. According to the results of the epidemiological study, the French agency found that patients, who were taking Actos for a long time to aid in type 2 diabetes mellitus, significantly increased risk of bladder cancer compared with patients who were taking other diabetes medications.<ref>http://www.medical-reference.net/2011/12/france-and-germany-suspended-use-of.html | France and Germany Suspended Use of Actos for Bladder Cancer Risk|</ref> On June 10, 2011 Germany's [[Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices]] also advised doctors not to prescribe the medication until further investigation of the cancer risk had been conducted.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/10/takeda-germany-idUSL3E7HA0X920110610 | work=Reuters | first=James | last=Topham | title=UPDATE 2-Germany joins France in suspending top Takeda drug | date=June 10, 2011}}</ref>

On June 15, 2011 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] announced that pioglitazone use for more than one year may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, and two months later the label was updated with an additional warning about this risk.<ref>FDA August 4, 2011.

==Drug interactions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Combination with [[sulfonylurea]]s or [[insulin]] reciprocally exponentiate risk of [[hypoglycemia]]. Therapy with pioglitazone increase the chance of pregnancy in individuals taking oral contraception.

==Pharmacology==
Pioglitazone selectively stimulates the [[nuclear receptor]] peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ([[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma|PPAR-γ]]) and to a lesser extent [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha|PPAR-α]].<ref name="pmid10983737">{{cite journal | title = Pioglitazone| journal = Drugs | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 333–43; discussion 344–5 |date=August 2000| pmid = 10983737 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200060020-00009| url = | last1 = Gillies | first1 = PS | last2 = Dunn | first2 = CJ }}</ref><ref name="pmid11594239">{{cite journal | author = Smith U | title = Pioglitazone: mechanism of action | journal = Int J Clin Pract Suppl | volume = | issue = 121 | pages = 13–8 |date=September 2001 | pmid = 11594239 | doi = | url = }}</ref> It modulates the transcription of the genes involved in the control of glucose and [[lipid metabolism]] in the [[muscle]], [[adipose tissue]], and the [[liver]]. As a result, pioglitazone reduces [[insulin resistance]] in the liver and peripheral tissues, decreases gluconeogenesis in the liver, and reduces quantity of glucose and [[glycated hemoglobin]] in the bloodstream.

More recently,<!-- 2004 and 2007 if you read the references{{When|date=March 2011}}--> pioglitazone and other active TZDs have been shown to bind to the [[outer mitochondrial membrane]] protein [[CDGSH iron sulfur domain|mitoNEET]] with affinity comparable to that of pioglitazone for PPARγ.<ref name="pmid14570702">{{cite journal
