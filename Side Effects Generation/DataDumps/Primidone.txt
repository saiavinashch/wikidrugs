'''Primidone''' ([[international nonproprietary name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]], [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]]) is an [[anticonvulsant]] of the [[barbiturate]] class.  It is a structural analog of [[phenobarbital]] and related to barbiturate-derivative anticonvulsants. The active [[metabolite]]s, [[phenobarbital]], ''p''-hydroxyphenobarbital, and [[phenylethylmalonamide]], are also anticonvulsants. Primidone was once a mainstay anticonvulsant in the treatment of [[partial seizure|partial]] and [[generalised epilepsy|generalized]] seizures and was the treatment of choice for secondarily generalized seizures originating in the [[temporal lobe]]s, especially when combined with [[phenytoin]], but by the early 1980s, [[carbamazepine]] had surpassed it in popularity due to the latter's lower incidence of [[sedation]]. As time passed and more and more anticonvulsants came on the market, primidone was pushed further and further away from its former place of prominence, and major Western [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical corporation]]s became less and less interested in [[pharmaceutical manufacturing|manufacturing]] and [[pharmaceutical marketing|selling]] it. It has largely fallen into disuse in the developed world as more and more anticonvulsants entered the market, and it has been withdrawn from various markets around the world.

===Essential tremor===
Primidone is considered to be a first-line therapy for [[essential tremor]] along with [[propranolol]]. In terms of tremor amplitude reduction, it is just as effective as propranolol, reducing it by 50%. Both drugs are well studied for this condition, unlike other therapies, and are recommended for initial treatment. 25&nbsp;mg/day (low-dose therapy) is just as good as 75&nbsp;mg/day (high-dose therapy).<ref name=Zesiewicz_et_al_2005>{{cite journal | vauthors=Zesiewicz TA, Elble R, Louis ED, Hauser RA, Sullivan KL, Dewey RB, Ondo WG, Gronseth GS, Weiner WJ |date = June 28, 2005 | title = Practice Parameter: Therapies for essential tremor: Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology  | journal = Neurology | volume = 64 | issue = 12 | pages = 2008–20 | doi = 10.1212/01.WNL.0000163769.28552.CD | pmid = 15972843 | url = http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/full/64/12/2008 | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref>

Primidone is not the only anticonvulsant used for essential tremor; the others include [[topiramate]] (Topamax) and [[gabapentin]] (Neurontin). Other pharmacological agents include [[alprazolam]] (Xanax), [[clonazepam]] (Klonopin), [[atenolol]], [[sotalol]], [[nadolol]], [[clozapine]], [[nimodipine]], and [[Botox|botilinum toxin A]]. Many of these drugs were less effective (according to Table 1), but a few were not. Only propranolol has been compared to primidone in a clinical trial.<ref name=Zesiewicz_et_al_2005/>

===Long QT syndrome===
The first case report in which the shortening of the [[QT interval]] by primidone was documented, published in the July 1980 issue of ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'', involved three patients, a 31-year-old woman, her 15-year-old nephew, and his 16-year-old sister. The woman still had [[ventricular fibrillation]], [[fainting|syncope]], and seizures even after the removal of her left [[stellate ganglion]] and a thoracic chain dissection. The woman had previously been tried on a combination of phenobarbital and phenytoin when she was thought to have only seizures, followed by phenobarbital combined phenytoin and [[procainamide]]. The procainamide was replaced with propanolol, which in turn replaced the propanolol when the latter brought the [[tachycardia]] back almost instantaneously upon the first dose. The phenobarbital and phenytoin were then combined with [[atropine]] and acetyl [[G-strophanthidin|strophanthidin]]. When this failed, the atropine and acetyl strophanthidin were replaced with [[lidocaine]] prior to the surgery. After the surgery, the QT-prolongation returned, so the phenytoin was doubled to 200&nbsp;mg four times daily. A month later, she was admitted to the hospital for phenytoin toxicity, where it was found that she had slow [[EEG|spike and abortive wave activity]] in her left [[temporal lobe]]. It was after this that primidone was substituted for phenytoin. The primidone suppressed the fibrillations and lengthened the [[QT interval]] for two years and eight months in the patient. Her 16-year-old niece was started on primidone after an unsuccessful trial of phenytoin. Following this, her 15-year-old nephew, the niece's brother, was started because of family history.<ref name=longqt1980>{{cite journal | author = DeSilvey DL |author2=Moss AJ |date=July 1980 | title = Primidone in the treatment of the long QT syndrome: QT shortening and ventricular arrhythmia suppression | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 93 | issue =  1 | pages = 53–4 | pmid = 7396315 | url = http://openurl.epnet.com/linksvc/linking.aspx?genre=article&sid=PubMed&issn=0003-4819&title=Ann%20Intern%20Med&volume=93&issue=1&spage=53&atitle=Primidone%20in%20the%20treatment%20of%20the%20long%20QT%20syndrome:%20QT%20shortening%20and%20ventricular%20arrhythmia%20suppression.&aulast=DeSilvey&date=1980 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-93-1-53}}</ref>

===Psychiatric disorders===
In 1965, Monroe and Wise reported using primidone along with a [[phenothiazine]] derivative [[antipsychotic]] and [[chlordiazepoxide]] in treatment-resistant [[psychosis]].<ref name=antipsychotic>{{cite journal | vauthors=Monroe RR, Wise SP |year=1965 | title = Combined phenothiazine, chlordiazepoxide and primidone therapy for uncontrolled psychotic patients | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 122 | issue = 6 | pages = 694–8 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.122.6.694 | pmid = 5320821   }}</ref> What is known is that ten years later, Monroe went on to publish the results of a [[meta-analysis]] of two controlled clinical trials on people displaying out-of-character and situationally inappropriate aggression, who had abnormal [[EEG]] readings, and who responded poorly to antipsychotics; one of the studies was specifically mentioned as involving psychosis patients. When they were given various anticonvulsants not only did their EEGs improve, but so did the aggression.<ref name=ictalaggression>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00005053-197502000-00006 | first = R.

In March 1993, S.G. Hayes of the University of Southern California School of Medicine reported that nine out of twenty-seven people (33%) with either [[treatment-resistant depression]] or treatment-resistant bipolar disorder had a permanent positive response to primidone. It should be noted that a plurality of subjects were also given [[methylphenobarbital]] in addition to or instead of primidone.<ref name=hayes1993>{{cite journal | first = S.

Five months later, Brown, Stone, and Rathbone published a case report titled, "Primidone and rapid cycling affective disorders" describing a 62-year-old woman who had rapid-cycling bipolar disorder starting in 1978. [[lithium salt|Lithium]] treatment was started two years later, but it only eliminated the manic swings, leaving her depressions unaffected. Between 1980 and 1989, the patient had six to ten episodes a year, each lasting between eleven and twenty-four days that left her with little energy, made tasks seem more arduous than they actually were, a smaller appetite, a tendency to sleep too much, anxious, and weepy. No antidepressant eliminated all her symptoms. At the age of fifty-eight, she was started on 125&nbsp;mg/day of primidone for hand tremor. Her depression, which was resistant to all the antidepressants she tried, gradually remitted during primidone therapy; the expected depressive episode lasted three days instead of 13-17. Eight weeks later, she had an episode lasting twenty-eight days. Her last two episodes were nineteen weeks apart, lasting twenty-five and twenty-seven days, respectively. It was during the final episode, in the middle of 1990, that her dose of primidone was stabilized at 500&nbsp;mg/day. She had been free of depression for two and a half years before the case report was written up.<ref name="bsr1993">{{cite journal | author = Brown GM |author2=Stone GH |author3=Rathbone MP  | date = October 9, 1993 | title = Primidone and rapid cycling affective disorders | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 342 | issue = 8876 | pages = 925 | pmid = 8105181 | url =  | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(93)91972-O}}</ref>

In 1999, Drs. Linda C. Schaffer, Charles B. Schaffer, and J. Caretto conducted a follow-up study on those earlier reports, as no one else had done so in the six years following their publication, and found it to be roughly as (permanently) effective for refractory bipolar disorder as Hayes had reported it to be (31% vs. Hayes's 33%). All subjects with a permanent and complete treatment response were either Bipolar I or Bipolar NOS. In this study, unlike the 1993 case report, primidone affected manic symptoms&mdash;especially insomnia, anxiety, and racing thoughts&mdash;and only on manic symptoms.<ref name=primidonebipolar2>{{cite journal | author = Schaffer LC |author2=Schaffer CB |author3=Caretto J  |date=June 1999 | title = The use of primidone in the treatment of refractory bipolar disorder | journal = Annals of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 61–6 | pmid = 10440522 | doi = 10.3109/10401239909147050}}</ref>

===Other===
Unlike [[carbamazepine]], there are few case reports mentioning the use of primidone in the treatment of [[trigeminal neuralgia]]. The first, published in the October 10, 1957 issue of ''Gazette Médicale de France'', has no abstract.<ref name=trigeminal_neuralgia_1>{{cite journal | first = M. | last = Bergouignan |date=October 1957 | title = [Recent developments in the medical treatment of essential trigeminal neuralgia: importance of various anti-epileptic medication.] | journal = Gazette Médicale de France | volume = 64 | issue = 19 | pages = 1571–2 passim | pmid = 13480440|language=fr}}</ref> The second one was a case report of a woman taking primidone and then phenobarbital for trigeminal neuralgia.

Two trials of primidone for athetosis have been published. In one, small doses of primidone successfully treated eighteen out of thirty-one children.

Primidone has been used in cerebral palsy. In 1953, Plum and Sparup found that out of thirty-three patients, twenty had a favorable or moderate response. Thorn reported in 1962 that sixteen patients responded favorably to both primidone and [[chlordiazepoxide]] and four to only primidone. Nine patients responded only to chlordiazepoxide and four responded to neither drug. The best results were obtained in athetosis and rigidity.<ref name=Thorn_et_al_1962>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8749.1962.tb03175.x | last = Thorn | first = I. |date=June 1962 | title = Primidone and chlordiazepoxide in cerebral palsy | journal = Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology | volume = 4 | pages = 325–7 | pmid = 13921015 | issue = 3 }}</ref>

[[File:Morbus dupuytren fcm.jpg|thumb|right|Dupuytren's contracture of the fourth digit (ring finger).]]
[[Dupuytren's contracture]], a disease of the [[fascia]]e in the palm and fingers that permanently bends the fingers (usually the little and ring fingers) toward the palm, was first noted to be highly prevalent in epileptic people in 1941 by a Dr. Lund, fourteen years before primidone was on the market. Lund also noted that it was equally prevalent in individuals with idiopathic and symptomatic epilepsy and that the severity of the epilepsy did not matter. However, only one quarter of the women were affected vs. half of the men.<ref name="Hart_and_Hooper2005">{{cite journal | last = Hart | first = M. G. |author2=G.

It has also been associated with [[alcoholism]], heavy smoking, [[diabetes mellitus]], physical trauma (either penetrating in nature or due to manual labor), [[tuberculosis]], and [[HIV]]. People with [[rheumatoid arthritis]] are less likely to get this, and Drs. Hart and Hooper speculate that this is also true of [[gout]] due to the use of [[allopurinol]] This is the only susceptibility factor that is generally agreed upon. Anticonvulsants do not seem to increase the incidence of Dupuytren's contracture in non-whites.<ref name="Hart_and_Hooper2005"/>

Primidone has other cardiovascular effects in beyond shortening the QT interval. Both it and phenobarbital are associated with elevated serum levels (both fasting and six hours after [[methionine]] loading) of [[homocysteine]], an [[amino acid]] derived from methionine. This is almost certainly related to the low folate levels reported in primidone users. Elevated levels of homocysteine have been linked to [[coronary heart disease]]. In 1985, both drugs were also reported to increase serum levels of [[high density lipoprotein]] (HDL) [[cholesterol]], total cholesterol, and [[apolipoprotein]]s A and B.<ref name="Schwaninger_et_al_1999">{{cite journal | last = Schwaninger | first = Markus |date=March 1999 | title = Elevated plasma concentrations of homocysteine in antiepileptic drug treatment |journal = [[Epilepsia (journal)|Epilepsia]] | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 345–350 | pmid = 10080517 | url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1999.tb00716.x | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2007-03-16 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1999.tb00716.x | last2 = Ringleb | first2 = P | last3 = Winter | first3 = R | last4 = Kohl | first4 = B | last5 = Fiehn | first5 = W | last6 = Rieser | first6 = PA | last7 = Walter-Sack | first7 = I}}</ref>

Anticonvulsants affect the bones in many ways. They cause [[hypophosphatemia]], [[hypocalcemia]], low Vitamin D levels, and increased [[parathyroid hormone]]. Anticonvulsants also contribute to the increased rate of fractures by causing somnolence, ataxia, and tremor which would cause gait disturbance, further increasing the risk of fractures on top of the increase due to seizures and the restrictions on activity placed on epileptic people.Increased fracture rate has also been reported for carbamazepine, valproate and clonazepam. The risk of fractures is higher for people taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants than for people taking non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants.<ref name=Arora_et_al_2006/> In addition to all of the above, primidone can cause [[arthralgia]].<ref name=AcorusPI/>

The major metabolite, phenobarbital, is also a potent anticonvulsant in its own right and likely contributes to primidone's effects in many forms of epilepsy. According to Brenner's Pharmacology textbook, Primidone also increases GABA-mediated chloride flux: thereby hyperpolarizing the membrane potential.

The percentage of primidone converted to phenobarbital has been estimated to be 5% in dogs and 15% in humans. Work done twelve years later found that the serum phenobarbital 0.111&nbsp;mg/100 mL for every mg/kg of primidone ingested. Authors publishing a year earlier estimated that 24.5% of primidone was metabolized to phenobarbital. However, the patient reported by Kappy and Buckley would have had a serum level of 44.4&nbsp;mg/100 mL instead of 8.5&nbsp;mg/100 mL if this were true for individuals who have ingested large dose. The patient reported by Morley and Wynne would have had serum barbiturate levels of 50&nbsp;mg/100 mL, which would have been fatal.<ref name=Kappy_et_al_1969/>

In Europe, up until 1963, it was not uncommon to prescribe primidone and phenobarbital in combination, often with a stimulant. They were believed to be the most useful for seizures occurring upon awakening, while phenytoin was the most useful for nocturnal seizures. Primidone and phenobarbital were prescribed in combination with phenytoin in diffuse epilepsies. They were third and fourth line-agents, respectively, in the treatment of partial seizures. By 1963, carbamazepine was marketed in most of Europe. It soon became clear that its efficacy in generalized tonic-clonic seizures was the same as phenytoin, that its ability to control partial seizures was superior, along with its tolerability. [[Sodium valproate]] was approved in France in 1967. Because the doses were so low (200–400&nbsp;mg/day), it was viewed as a moderately effective anticonvulsant whose best quality was its nonsedating nature. In spite of the availability of carbamazepine and valproate, physicians practicing in Mediterranean countries still preferred phenobarbital. Other medications were seen as not usually necessary. Phenytoin was to be used as adjunctive therapy only.<ref name=Loiseau_et_al_1999/> In spite of these advances, primidone was still considered to be a "sheet-anchor" anticonvulsant in the [[United Kingdom]] as late as 1969, along with phenobarbital and phenytoin, for the treatment of pediatric epilepsy in spite of its side effects<ref name="Wilson1969">{{cite journal | last = Wilson | first = John | date = November 22, 1969 | title = Drug treatment of epilepsy in childhood | journal = [[British Medical Journal]] | volume = 4 | issue = 5681 | pages = 475–7 | pmid = 4390959 |pmc=1630558 | url = | doi = 10.1136/bmj.4.5681.475 }}</ref> and one of two drugs (the other being [[sultiame]]) that were tried in adult patients if a combination of phenytoin and phenobarbital failed to control seizures.

In 1968, a Dr. Meadow encountered six babies with cleft lip and palate in addition to other congenital abnormalities whose mothers had been taking anticonvulsants. Meadow wrote a letter in ''[[The Lancet]]'' asking for cases of cleft lip and palate in babies whose mothers had taken anticonvulsants.

Carbamazepine was approved in the United States for the treatment of adult epilepsy in 1974.

In 1990, primidone, along with phenobarbital, was a second-line agent in partial epilepsy with or without secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures and was one of four agents (the others being carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital) that was used along with [[ethosuximide]] or a [[benzodiazepine]] for any [[absence seizure|absence]] or [[myoclonus|myoclonic seizure]]s when valproate failed to control tonic-clonics (at least in the United States).<ref name=In_1990>{{cite journal | first = R.

All four were structurally distinct both from other anticonvulsants already on the market. They all had larger protective indexes than conventional agents and unlike these agents, the new ones did not cause birth defects in laboratory animals or antagonize folic acid. They seemed to be relatively mild in terms of side effects. Out of all of them lamotrigine was the most similar to phenytoin in its pattern of efficacy. Felbamate was the most effective for [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]] and was seen as a second-line agent in [[juvenile myoclonic epilepsy]] after valproate. These new agents were aggressively marketed. In 1994, felbamate became the anticonvulsant of last resort after ten people out of 100,000 came down with [[aplastic anemia]].<ref name=Laxer_1994>{{cite journal | first = K.

By 1994, primidone was no longer one of the most widely used anticonvulsants. Phenytoin was still regarded as the drug of choice for partial seizures due to its long half-life and low cost; but for children, carbamazepine was seen as the best one due to phenytoin's effects on physical appearance.<ref name=Laxer_1994/> [[Topiramate]] was approved two years later. It, along with the others, was mainly used in patients refractory to carbamazepine and valproate. These new agents were often described as having "innovative" and "selective" mechanisms of action; in reality, most of them also worked similarly to older agents.<ref name=Perucca_1996>{{cite journal | first = Emilio | last = Perucca | year = 1996 | title = The new generation of antiepileptic drugs: advantages and disadvantages | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 42 | pages = 531–43 | pmid = 8951184 | url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2125.1996.tb00046.x | accessdate = 2007-09-24 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1996.tb00046.x | issue = 5}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> On February 28, 1998, [[Élan|Élan Corporation]], [[Public limited company|plc]], bought the trademark and exclusive product distribution rights for Mysoline from Wyeth in Canada and the United States at a cost of $46 million and a royalty on future sales.<ref name=elanmysoline>{{cite web|author=Élan Corporation, plc |url=http://www.elan.com/Images/2_1755_tcm3-4228.pdf |title=Product Acquisitions |format=PDF |work=Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the fiscal year ended: December 31, 1998 |accessdate=2005-07-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050523050926/http://www.elan.com/Images/2_1755_tcm3-4228.pdf |archivedate=2005-05-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The actual manufacture and distribution was done by [[Athena Neurosciences]]; their name appeared on a Mysoline package information sheet dated June 1998.<ref name=athenamysoline>{{cite web | author = Medscape | authorlink = Medscape | url = http://www.medscape.com/content/2002/00/43/02/430209/430209_ref.html | title = Athena Neurosciences.
