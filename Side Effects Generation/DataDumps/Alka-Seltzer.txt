'''Alka-Seltzer''' is an [[Effervescent tablet|effervescent]] [[antacid]] and pain reliever first marketed by the [[Miles Laboratories|Dr. Miles Medicine Company]] of [[Elkhart, Indiana]], United States.  It was developed by head chemist Maurice Treneer.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FY35-noly_IC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=alka-seltzer+treener&source=bl&ots=5LAjVPzTFR&sig=01yChrepb0TQtu_UDbBLjVE_Qwc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-nKDUL-1KeLg2gWckoDIAw&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Origin of Everyday Things] by Think Books (editor), Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., Nov 28, 2006 page 12.

Simon and Schuster, 1992</ref> A spin-off of Alka-Seltzer made to relieve colds and flu, '''Alka-Seltzer Plus''', was later introduced. A short-lived antacid non-aspirin variant, '''Alka-Mints''', was introduced in 1994 and discontinued in 1997. Another non-aspirin-based variant, '''Alka-Seltzer Gold''', was later released.

Since 1978 Alka-Seltzer has been owned by [[Bayer|Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consumerhealth.bayer.com/scripts/pages/en/global_footprint/leading_growth/index.php|title=Consumer Health - Leading Growth|publisher=}}</ref>  The name "Alka-Seltzer" has been extended to incorporate an entire line of [[medication]]s sold [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] and taken by means of rapidly dissolving tablets that form a carbonated solution in water.

The brand is sold in [[North America|North and]] [[Central America]] (and the [[Caribbean]]), as well in [[Australia]] and [[Asia-Pacific]]. In the 1980s and 1990s Bayer attempted to introduce the brand in Europe and [[South America]] with little success, withdrawing them after a few years.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Composition==
Alka-Seltzer contains three active ingredients; aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) (ASA), [[sodium bicarbonate]], and [[anhydrous]]
[[citric acid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alkaseltzer.ie/en/about-alka-seltzer/|title=Alka Seltzer Directions of use, Sodium & Aspirin content - Alka Seltzer relief from Headaches, Migraine & Upset stomach|work=alkaseltzer.ie}}</ref> The aspirin is a pain reliever and [[anti-inflammatory]], and the sodium bicarbonate and citric acid form an antacid by their effervescent reaction with water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/digestive-health/medicines/alka-seltzer-original.html|title=Alka-seltzer original|work=Netdoctor}}</ref>

==Marketing==
The product has been extensively [[advertising|advertised]] since its launch in the U.S.  It was originally marketed by Mikey Wiseman, a company scientist of Dr. Miles Medicine Company, who also helped direct its development.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Print advertising was used immediately, and in 1932 the radio show ''Alka-Seltzer Comedy Star of Hollywood'' began, with ''National Barn Dance'' following in 1933, along with many more. The radio sponsorships continued into the 1950s, ending with the ''[[Alka-Seltzer Time]]'' show.

Two years after its launch came the repeal of Prohibition in the US, and Alka-Seltzer became Miles' new flagship product, displacing Miles Nervine Tonic.

In 1951 the "Speedy" character was introduced. The character was created by ad writer Chuck Tenant and designed by commercial artist Bob Watkins, both of the Wade Advertising agency.<ref>http://advertisingiconmuseum.org/inside/c5/3249039.html</ref>  Originally named Sparky, the name was changed to Speedy by sales manager Perry L. Shupert to align with that year's promotional theme, "Speedy Relief."  Speedy appeared in over 200 TV commercials between 1954 and 1964.  His body was one Alka-Seltzer tablet, while he wore another as a hat.  In his original spots he sang "Relief is just a swallow away"; in his 1978 revival he proclaimed Alka-Seltzer's virtues and sang the "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is" song in his high, squeaky voice (provided by veteran juvenile voice actor [[Dick Beals]]).<ref name="75thAnniversary">{{cite web|url=http://www.alkaseltzer.com/as/faqs.html|title=Alka-Seltzer FAQs|work=alkaseltzer.com}}</ref>  In the early 1960s a commercial showing two tablets dropping into a glass of water instead of the usual one caused sales to double.<ref name="snopes">{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/alka-seltzer.asp|title=Alka-Seltzer Marketing : snopes.com|author=snopes|date=29 January 2016|work=snopes}}</ref> In December 2010 Alka-Seltzer began a series of new commercials featuring Speedy, using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects to recreate the [[stop-motion]] puppetry of the 1950s and 1960s, with Speedy voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]].

===US TV commercials===
[[Image:Alka Seltzer tablet.JPG|right|thumbnail|Alka Seltzer Plus tablet]]
Alka-Seltzer TV ads from the 1960s and 1970s in the US were among the most popular of the 20th century, ranking number 13, according to ''[[Advertising Age]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} To increase sales in a relatively flat business, Bayer has revived several of the vintage spots.<ref name="NYTimes"/>

The famous "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz" commercial song was written by Tom Dawes, who was a former member of [[The Cyrkle]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/02/arts/02dawes.html|date=2 November 2007|title=Thomas Dawes, Musician and Jingle Writer, Dies at 64|last=Peterson|first=Alison J|access-date=27 December 2016}}</ref>

* During the race for space in the early 1960s before the USA moon landing there was a commercial with Speedy in a space suit and a jingle with the lyrics  
<blockquote>On Man's first trip through space, I only hope that I'm aboard, 
securely strapped in place. They'll track our ship with radar and telescopes and soon, imagine seeing Speedy Alka-Seltzer on the moon!</blockquote>

* [[Buster Keaton]] appeared along with the animated Speedy Alka-Seltzer figure in a series of 1950s commercials based on the product's then-current slogan, "Relief is just a swallow away." Speedy Alka-Seltzer was voiced by [[Dick Beals]]. Speedy was revived for one of the "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz" song spots in 1978.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5G4USWB79c|title=ALKA-SELTZER VINTAGE TELEVISION COMMERCIAL "Pop Pop Fizz Fizz"|date=3 February 2012|work=YouTube}}</ref>
* [[George Raft]] starred in the 1969 Alka-Seltzer commercial "The Unfinished Lunch." It consists of Raft incarcerated and in the prison lunchroom. He takes a bite of the [[prison food]] and recoils. Suddenly he bangs his cup on the steel table. It ripples throughout the room. He starts intoning "Alka-Seltzer, Alka-Seltzer..." Soon, the other hundreds of inmates do the same. (The commercial was so popular that several weeks later Raft appeared as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Raft told Carson that it took more than 7 hours to tape the 30-second commercial. Raft was enraged by the end of the day, thus making his inmate portrayal that much more convincing for the final editing.  The film crew gave Raft his crumpled tin cup, which he showed to Carson and the audience.)
* An animated mid-1960s commercial, animated by [[R.O. Blechman]], shows a man and his own stomach sitting opposite each other in chairs, having an argument moderated by their therapist in a voiceover.<ref name="NYTimes"/> The stomach (voiced by [[Gene Wilder]]) accuses the man of purposely trying to irritate it. The man accuses his stomach of complaining too much about the foods he likes. The therapist suggests Alka-Seltzer, and further suggests that the two must take care of each other. The closing words are of the stomach saying to the man: "Well, I'll try — if ''you'' will."
* Alka-Seltzer had a series of commercials during the mid-1960s that used a song called "[[No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In)]]." A different version was recorded by [[the T-Bones]] and was released as a single, which became a hit in 1966. The ads were unique in that they featured only the midsections (no faces) of people of all shapes and sizes. A version of this ad can be seen briefly in the 1988 motion picture ''[[The In Crowd (1988 film)|The In Crowd]]'', immediately before the movie's first live broadcast of the fictitious "Perry Parker's Dance Party." 
* In an Alka-Seltzer commercial from 1969, an actor (played by [[Jack Somack]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0813755/otherworks|title=Jack Somack - Other works|work=IMDb}}</ref>) in a commercial for the fictional product "Magdalini's Meatballs" has to eat a [[meatball]] and then say, "Mamma mia, that's-a ''spicy'' meat-ball!" in an thick Italian accent.  Numerous takes are ruined by various errors, as comedian [[Ronny Graham]] drops the [[clapperboard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://triviafrog.com/?p=70|title=Commercials: Alka Seltzer and Spicy Meatballs|work=triviafrog.com}}</ref> By take 59, Jack has eaten so many meatballs that he can't continue, and it's "Alka Seltzer to the rescue." With his stomach settled, Jack does a perfect take, and then the oven door falls off.  The director sighs and says, "okay, let's break for lunch."
* A 1970 commercial shows a newlywed couple in the bedroom after the woman (played by [[Alice Playten]]) has finished serving her husband (played by [[Terry Kiser]]) a giant [[dumpling]]; the implication is that her cooking skills are severely lacking, despite her husband's lament, "I can't believe I ate that whole thing!", the commercial's catch-phrase. She lies on the bed in delusional triumph. She offers her beleaguered husband a heart-shaped [[meatloaf]]; he disappears to take some Alka-Seltzer. When she hears the fizzy noise coming from the bathroom, he quickly covers the glass of dissolving Alka-Seltzer as she wonders aloud if it is raining. Just when he has recovered his well-being, he hears her misreading recipes for dinner the next night: "[[Marshmallow]]ed [[meatball]]s," ,"medium [[salad]] [[snail]]s and "pouched (actually [[Poaching (cooking)|poached]]) oysters". He returns to the bathroom for more Alka-Seltzer.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The catch-phrase, [[Howie Cohen]] told ''The Los Angeles Times'', was inspired when he ate too much of the food at a London commercial shoot because "I am a nice Jewish kid from the Bronx, so I ate everything," and when he told his wife "I can't believe I ate the whole thing", she said, "There's your next Alka-Seltzer commercial."<ref name=Crain>{{cite journal|title=For This Industry Veteran, The Past Was Great, But The Future's More Exciting|last=Crain|first=Rance|work=[[Advertising Age]]|date=2015-03-02|volume=86|issue=4}}</ref> 
* A 1971 commercial featured another catch-phrase from Cohen (along with Bob Pasqualina),<ref name=Crain/> "''Try'' it, you'll ''like'' it!" It was remade with [[Kathy Griffin]] in 2006.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/19/business/media/19adco.html|title=Try It; You Liked It Once, and Alka-Seltzer Hopes You Do Again|date=19 June 2006|work=The New York Times}}</ref>
* In 1972, an actor ([[Milt Moss]]) spent the commercial moaning, "I can't believe I ate that who-o-o-o-o-ole thing," while his wife ([[Lynn Whinic]]) made sarcastic comments and finally advised him to take some Alka-Seltzer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elliott |first=Stuart |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/19/business/media/19adco.html?ex=1308369600&en=547d07b6d0bf4e89&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |title=Try It; You Liked It Once, and Alka-Seltzer Hopes You Do Again - New York Times |location=New York City |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2006-06-19 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> In 2005, this ad was also remade, featuring [[Peter Boyle]] and [[Doris Roberts]] from the 1996–2005 TV [[sitcom]] ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]].''<ref name="NYTimes"/>
* [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] recorded two versions of the famous "Plop Plop Fizz Fizz" jingle in 1978, one of which (the "big band" version) was featured on a television commercial. Both the big band and rock versions had additional lyrics (with at least one verse unique to each song) written by Tom Dawes, former lead singer of [[The Cyrkle]] who wrote the original jingle.
* In 2009, the brand was featured in television commercials supporting the United States Ski Team that included [[Alpine skiing|alpine skier]] [[Lindsey Vonn]] and [[Nordic combined]] skier [[Bill Demong]]. Miniature figures of the Speedy mascot were shown with each.
