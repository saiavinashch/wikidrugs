'''Canada''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=EN-CA-Canada.ogg|ˈ|k|æ|n|ə|d|ə}}; {{IPA-fr|kanadɑ|lang}}) is a country in the northern part of [[North America]]. Its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering {{convert|9.98|e6km2|e6sqmi|2|abbr=off}}, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest country by total area]] and the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|fourth-largest country by land area]]. Canada's southern border [[Canada–United States border|with the United States]] is the world's longest bi-national land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is highly [[urbanization|urbanized]] with 82 per cent of the 35.15&nbsp;million people concentrated in large and medium-sized cities, many near the southern border. Its capital is [[Ottawa]], and its [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]] are [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]] and [[Vancouver]].

Various [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous peoples]] have inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years prior to European colonization. Beginning in the 16th century, the [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] established colonies, the first being the [[Canada (New France)|colony of Canada]] established by France in 1535. As a consequence of [[Military history of Canada|various armed conflicts]], [[British North America]] gained and lost territory until, by the late 18th century, it controlled most of what comprises Canada today. On July 1, 1867, the colonies of [[Province of Canada|Canada]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Nova Scotia]] were federated to form the semi-autonomous [[Canadian federalism|federal Dominion]] named Canada. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion]] of provinces and territories to the [[Dominion]] to the present ten provinces and three territories forming contemporary Canada. In 1931, Canada achieved near-total independence from the United Kingdom with the ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931]]'', except for the power to amend [[Constitution of Canada|its constitution]]. With the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982|Constitution Act]]'' of 1982, Canada took over that authority (as the conclusion of [[Patriation]]).

Canada is a [[federation|federal]] [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Queen [[Elizabeth II]] being the [[head of state]]. The country is [[Official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] nations, the product of [[Immigration to Canada|large-scale immigration]] from many other countries. Its advanced economy is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|tenth-largest in the world]], relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada's [[Canada–United States relations|long and complex relationship]] with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.

Canada is a [[developed country]] and has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|fifteenth-highest]] nominal per capita income globally as well as the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|tenth-highest]] ranking in the [[Human Development Index]]. It [[International rankings of Canada|ranks among the highest]] in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a [[Commonwealth realm|realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]], and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the [[United Nations]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], the [[Group of Seven|G7]] (formerly [[Group of Eight|G8]]), the [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten]], the [[G20]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum.

===Provinces and territories===
{{Main article|Provinces and territories of Canada}}
{{See also|Canadian federalism}}

Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three [[territory (administrative division)|territories]]. In turn, these may be grouped into [[List of regions of Canada|four main regions]]: [[Western Canada]], [[Central Canada]], [[Atlantic Canada]], and [[Northern Canada]] (''Eastern Canada'' refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[Social programs in Canada|welfare]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=G.

Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jason Clemens|author2=Niels Veldhuis|title=Beyond Equalization: Examining Fiscal Transfers in a Broader Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yc6RakXxLy0C&pg=PA8|year=2012|publisher=[[Fraser Institute]]|isbn=978-0-88975-215-3|page=8|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412150638/https://books.google.com/books?id=yc6RakXxLy0C&pg=PA8|archivedate=April 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
