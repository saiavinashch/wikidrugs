====Headache====
Aspirin, either by itself or in a combined formulation, effectively treats certain [[Headache#Classification|types of a headache]], but its efficacy may be questionable for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider.

Among primary headaches, the [[International Classification of Headache Disorders]] distinguishes between [[tension headache]] (the most common), migraine, and [[cluster headache]]. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headache.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Loder|first1=E|author2=Rizzoli, P|title=Tension-type headache|journal=[[The BMJ|BMJ (Clinical research ed.)]]|date=12 January 2008 | volume=336 | issue=7635 | pages=88–92 | pmid=18187725 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39412.705868.AD|pmc=2190284}}</ref>

Aspirin, especially as a component of an [[aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine]] [[combination drug|combination]], is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of [[sumatriptan]]. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gilmore|first1=B|author2=Michael, M|title=Treatment of acute migraine headache|journal=American family physician|date=1 February 2011|volume=83|issue=3|pages=271–80|pmid=21302868}}</ref>

===Fever===
Like its ability to control pain, aspirin's ability to control [[fever]] is due to its action on the [[prostaglandin]] system through its irreversible inhibition of [[COX]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bartfai|first1=T|author2=Conti, B|title=Fever|journal=[[The Scientific World Journal]]|date=16 March 2010|volume=10|pages=490–503|doi=10.1100/tsw.2010.50|pmid=20305990|pmc=2850202}}</ref> Although aspirin's use as an [[antipyretic]] in adults is well-established, many medical societies and regulatory agencies (including the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)) strongly advise against using aspirin for treatment of fever in children because of the risk of [[Reye's syndrome]], a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pugliese|first1=A|author2=Beltramo, T |author3=Torre, D|title=Reye's and Reye's-like syndromes|journal=Cell biochemistry and function|date=October 2008|volume=26|issue=7|pages=741–6|pmid=18711704|doi=10.1002/cbf.1465}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beutler|first1=AI|author2=Chesnut, GT |author3=Mattingly, JC |author4=Jamieson, B|title=FPIN's Clinical Inquiries.

Aspirin is used as an [[anti-inflammatory agent]] for both acute and long-term [[inflammation]],<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Thea Morris, Melanie Stables, Adrian Hobbs, Patricia de Souza, Paul Colville-Nash, Tim Warner, Justine Newson, Geoffrey Bellingan, and Derek W.

====After surgery====
After [[percutaneous coronary intervention]]s (PCIs), such as the placement of a [[coronary artery]] [[stent]], a U.S. [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web|last=National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)|title=2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI guideline for percutaneous coronary artery intervention.

This is called dual [[antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet therapy]] (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Musumeci|first1=G|author2=Di Lorenzo, E |author3=Valgimigli, M|title=Dual antiplatelet therapy duration: what are the drivers?|journal=[[Current Opinion in Cardiology]]|date=December 2011|volume=26 Suppl 1|pages=S4–14|pmid=22129582|doi=10.1097/01.hco.0000409959.11246.ba}}</ref> However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.

===Other uses===
Aspirin is a first-line treatment for the fever and joint-pain symptoms of [[rheumatic fever|acute rheumatic fever]]. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease.<ref name=NHFA>{{cite web |url=http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/ClinicalResources/RACGPGuidelines/DiagnosisandmanagementofacuterheumaticfeverandrheumaticheartdiseaseinAustralia/NHFA-CSANZ_ARF_RHD_2006.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726052030/http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/ClinicalResources/RACGPGuidelines/DiagnosisandmanagementofacuterheumaticfeverandrheumaticheartdiseaseinAustralia/NHFA-CSANZ_ARF_RHD_2006.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-26 |title=Diagnosis and management of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in Australia.

[[File:5 grain aspirin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The 5-grain aspirin. The usage guidance label on a bottle of aspirin indicates that the dosage is "325&nbsp;mg (5&nbsp;gr)".]]
Adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300&nbsp;mg in Britain and 325&nbsp;mg (or 5 [[Grain (unit)|grains]]) in the United States. Smaller doses are based on these standards, ''e.g.'', 75&nbsp;mg and 81&nbsp;mg tablets.

===Skin===
For a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms resembling an allergic reaction, including [[hives]], swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by [[salicylate intolerance]] and is not a true [[allergy]], but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an [[#Overdose|overdose]].

Aspirin and other NSAIDs can cause [[hyperkalemia|abnormally high blood levels of potassium]] by inducing a [[hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism|hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state]] via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state.<ref>Medical knowledge self-assessment program for students 4, By American College of Physicians, Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine, Nephrology 227, Item 29</ref>

==Chemical properties==
Aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of [[ammonium acetate]] or the [[acetate]]s, [[carbonate]]s, [[citrate]]s, or [[hydroxide]]s of the [[alkali metals]]. It is stable in dry air, but gradually [[hydrolyses]] in contact with moisture to [[acetic acid|acetic]] and [[salicylic acid]]s.

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an [[ester]]ification reaction. [[Salicylic acid]] is treated with [[acetic anhydride]], an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's [[hydroxyl]] group into an [[ester]] group (R-OH → R-OCOCH<sub>3</sub>). This process yields aspirin and [[acetic acid]], which is considered a [[byproduct]] of this reaction. Small amounts of [[sulfuric acid]] (and occasionally [[phosphoric acid]]) are almost always used as a [[catalyst]]. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Experimental organic chemistry |last=Palleros |first=Daniel R |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York | isbn=0-471-28250-2 |page=494}}</ref>

===Polymorphism===
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]], or the ability of a substance to form more than one [[crystal structure]], is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vishweshwar | first1 = P | last2 = McMahon | first2 = JA | last3 = Oliveira | first3 = M | last4 = Peterson | first4 = ML | last5 = Zaworotko | first5 = MJ | title = The predictably elusive form II of aspirin | journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] | volume = 127 | issue = 48 | pages = 16802–16803 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16316223 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1021/ja056455b }}</ref> and fine structural details were given by Bond ''et al.''<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Bond, Andrew D |author2=Boese, Roland |author3=Desiraju, Gautam R |title = On the polymorphism of aspirin: crystalline aspirin as intergrowths of two "polymorphic" domains |journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] |year = 2007|volume = 46|issue = 4|pages = 618–622|doi = 10.1002/anie.200603373 |pmid= 17139692}}</ref> A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and [[levetiracetam]] from hot [[acetonitrile]].

===Discovery of the mechanism===

===Prostaglandins and thromboxanes===
Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX; officially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, PTGS) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a [[serine]] residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as [[diclofenac]] and [[ibuprofen]]), which are reversible inhibitors ([[Suicide inhibition]]).

Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>]] in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |title=Aspirin in heart attack and stroke prevention |accessdate=8 May 2008 |publisher=American Heart Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331031146/http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |archivedate=31 March 2008 }}</ref> 40&nbsp;mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Tohgi |first1=H |author2=S Konno |author3=K Tamura |author4=B Kimura |author5=K Kawano|year = 1992|title = Effects of low-to-high doses of aspirin on platelet aggregability and metabolites of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin|journal = [[Stroke (journal)|Stroke]] | volume = 23|pages = 1400–1403 |pmid=1412574|issue = 10| doi=10.1161/01.STR.23.10.1400}}</ref>

Prostaglandins, local [[hormone]]s produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form [[clot|blood clots]]. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction.

===COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition===
At least two different types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory.<ref>{{cite journal|
volume=2|issue=3|title=Pharmacokinetic solubility and dissolution profile of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs |author=Achhrish goel |author2=Ruchi gupta |author3=Anubhav goswami |author4=Madhu soodan |author5=sharma Yogesh sharma |year=2011}}</ref>{{vn|date=August 2016}} Newer NSAID drugs, [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.<ref name=COX2002/>

However, several of the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx), have been withdrawn in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Current Pharmaceutical Design]] |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=22 |pages=2215–27 |title=Mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of COX-inhibition: benefits and risks |author=Martínez-González J |author2=Badimon L |pmid=17691994 |doi=10.2174/138161207781368774 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology]] |title=COX-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk |author=Funk CD |author2=FitzGerald GA |date=November 2007 |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=470–9 |pmid=18030055 |doi=10.1097/FJC.0b013e318157f72d }}</ref> Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of [[PGI2]] is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.

Furthermore, aspirin, while inhibiting the ability of COX-2 to form pro-inflammatory products such as the [[prostaglandins]], converts this enzyme's activity from a prostaglandin-forming cyclooxygenase to a [[lipoxygenase]]-like enzyme: aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes a variety of [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to [[specialized proresolving mediators]] such as the aspirin-triggered [[lipoxin]]s, aspirin-triggered [[resolvins]], and aspirin-triggered [[maresin]]s.  These mediators possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. It is proposed that this aspirin-triggered transition of COX-2 from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin.<ref name="pmid25895638">{{cite journal | vauthors = Romano M, Cianci E, Simiele F, Recchiuti A | title = Lipoxins and aspirin-triggered lipoxins in resolution of inflammation | journal = [[European Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 760 | issue = | pages = 49–63 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25895638 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.03.083 | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid23747022">{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N | title = Resolution phase lipid mediators of inflammation: agonists of resolution | journal = [[Current Opinion in Pharmacology]] | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 632–40 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23747022 | pmc = 3732499 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2013.05.012 | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid26546723">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weylandt KH | title = Docosapentaenoic acid derived metabolites and mediators - The new world of lipid mediator medicine in a nutshell | journal = [[European Journal of Pharmacology]]  | volume = 785| issue = | pages = 108–115| year = 2015 | pmid = 26546723 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.11.002}}</ref>

===Additional mechanisms===
Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action. It uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons.<ref name="SomasundaramS">{{Cite journal|author1=Somasundaram|first2=G|first3=RJ|first4=J|first5=M|first6=IA|first7=S|first8=A|first9=R|issue=5|last2=Sigthorsson|last3=Simpson|last4=Watts|last5=Jacob|last6=Tavares|last7=Rafi|last8=Roseth|last9=Foster |year=2000|title=Uncoupling of intestinal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and inhibition of cyclooxygenase are required for the development of NSAID-enteropathy in the rat|journal=[[Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics]] |volume=14 |pages=639–650 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.2000.00723.x |pmid=10792129|last10=Price|last11=Wrigglesworth|last12=Bjarnason|first10=AB|first12=I| displayauthors=9 }}</ref> Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses.

Aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects.

Acetylsalicylic acid is a [[weak acid]], and very little of it is [[Acid dissociation constant|ionized]] in the [[stomach]] after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the [[acidic]] conditions of the stomach. The increased [[pH]] and larger surface area of the [[small intestine]] causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised.

About 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound to [[albumin|albumin protein]], while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.<ref name="G Levy"/>

As much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]]. [[Conjugated system|Conjugation]] with [[glycine]] forms [[salicyluric acid]], and with [[glucuronic acid]] to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the ''acyl glucuronide''; the deacetylated conjugate is the ''phenolic glucuronide''. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to [[gentisic acid]]. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as [[metabolic pathway]]s become saturated and [[kidney|renal]] excretion becomes increasingly important.<ref name="G Levy"/>

Salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), [[gentisic acid]] (< 1%), and [[2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid|2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid is a product of human aspirin metabolism |authors=Martin Grootveld, Barry Halliwell |journal=[[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]] |volume =37 |issue =2 |date=15 January 1988 |pages=271–280 |pmid=3342084 |doi=10.1016/0006-2952(88)90729-0 }}</ref> When small doses (less than 250&nbsp;mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h.<ref name="O Hartwig">{{Cite journal |title=Pharmacokinetic considerations of common analgesics and antipyretics |journal=[[American Journal of Medicine]] |date=14 November 1983|first=Otto H|last=Hartwig|volume=75|issue=5A|pages=30–7 |pmid=6606362 |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(83)90230-9 }}</ref><ref name="AK Done">{{Cite journal |title=Salicylate intoxication.

===Trademark===
Due to allowing the use of "Aspirin" for years by other manufacturing chemists, despite the trademark-infringing nature of the use, and its own failure to use the name for its own product when it began selling direct, Bayer lost its trademark in the United States in 1918, affirmed by court appeal in 1921.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co. |vol=272 |reporter=F. |opinion=505 |pinpoint=p.512 |court=S.D.N.Y |date=1921 |url=https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/bayer.htm |accessdate=2015-09-01 |quote=Disregarding this, however, it was too late in the autumn of 1915 to reclaim the word which had already passed into the public domain. If the consuming public had once learned to know 'Aspirin' as the accepted name for the drug, perhaps it is true that an extended course of education might have added to it some proprietary meaning, but it would be very difficult to prove that it had been done in 17 months, and in any case the plaintiff does not try to prove it. [...] Yet, had it not been indifferent to the results of selling to the consumer, it could have protected itself just as well at the time when consumers began to buy directly as in 1915. Nothing would have been easier than to insist that the tablet makers should market the drug in small tin boxes bearing the plaintiff's name, or to take over the sale just as it did later. Instead of this, they allowed the manufacturing chemists to build up this part of the demand without regard to the trademark. Having made that bed, they must be content to lie in it. Hence it appears to me that nothing happening between October 1915, and March 1917, will serve to turn the word into a trademark.}}</ref> Today, aspirin is a [[generic trademark|generic word]] in Australia, France, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, Jamaica, Colombia, the Philippines, South Africa, Ghana, the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Scientific style and format: the CBE manual for authors, editors, and publishers |author1 = CBE Style Manual Committee |author2 = Huth, Edward J. |publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1994 |page = 164 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PoFJ-OhE63UC&pg=PA164 |isbn = 978-0-521-47154-1 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151015200126/https://books.google.com/books?id=PoFJ-OhE63UC&pg=PA164 |archivedate = 15 October 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Aspirin, with a capital "A", remains a registered trademark of Bayer in Germany, Canada, Mexico, and in over 80 other countries, where the trademark is owned by Bayer, using acetylsalicylic acid in all markets, but using different packaging and physical aspects for each.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/aspirin-the-versatile-drug-1.822289 | work=CBC News | title=Aspirin: the versatile drug | date=28 May 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106123159/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/aspirin-the-versatile-drug-1.822289 | archivedate=6 November 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last = Cheng | first = Tsung O. | title = The history of aspirin | journal = [[Texas Heart Institute Journal]] | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 392–393 | pmid = 17948100 | year = 2007 | pmc = 1995051 }}</ref>

== Veterinary medicine ==
Aspirin is sometimes used for pain relief or as an anticoagulant in veterinary medicine, primarily in dogs and sometimes horses, although newer medications with fewer side effects are generally used instead.

Both dogs and horses are susceptible to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, but it is a convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of [[laminitis]] in horses.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}<ref name="CambridgeH">{{Cite journal |vauthors = Cambridge H, Lees P, Hooke RE, Russell CS |title=Antithrombotic actions of aspirin in the horse |journal=[[Equine Veterinary Journal]] |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=123–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1904347|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1991.tb02736.x }}</ref> It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment.
