==Medical uses==

=== Patent ductus arteriosus ===
Alprostadil is also used in maintaining a [[patent ductus arteriosus]] in [[newborn]]s. This is primarily useful when the threat of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus exists in an infant with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease, including cyanotic lesions (e.g., hypoplastic left heart syndrome,  pulmonary atresia/stenosis, tricuspid atresia/stenosis, transposition of the great arteries) and acyanotic lesions (e.g., coarctation of the aorta, critical aortic stenosis, and interrupted aortic arch).

=== Sexual dysfunction ===
Alprostadil is sold in the United States as [[urethra]]l [[suppository|suppositories]] and in injectable form.  The suppositories are sold under the brand name Muse.<ref>{{cite web|title=Muse Suppository - Facts and Comparisons|url=http://www.drugs.com/cdi/muse-suppository.html|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=4 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119131710/http://www.drugs.com/cdi/muse-suppository.html|archivedate=19 January 2013|df=}}</ref> The injectable forms are Edex<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/cdi/edex.html Edex - Facts and Comparisons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026073759/http://www.drugs.com/cdi/edex.html |date=2012-10-26 }} Drugs.com</ref> and Caverject.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/cdi/caverject.html Caverject - Facts and Comparisons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026075757/http://www.drugs.com/cdi/caverject.html |date=2012-10-26 }} Drugs.com</ref>  Muse delivers alprostadil as a penile suppository, inserted into the urethra, at least ten minutes before the erection is needed. Caverject and Edex are similarly fast-acting, but instead are injected by syringe directly into the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum of the penis]].

Alprostadil is also available as a generic. The major cost is that it must be mixed by a [[compounding|compounding pharmacy]] and supplies may be difficult to obtain. The different formulations, including [[Bimix]] and [[Trimix (injection)|Trimix]], may include [[papaverine]] and/or [[phentolamine]]. A typical mix might be 30&nbsp;mg of papaverine, 2&nbsp;mg of phentolamine, and  20 μg alprostadil.  As a generic, it is much less expensive than the packaged injectables. It is premixed and must be kept refrigerated and the user must load a syringe with the quantity needed.

Most recently, the compound has been made easily accessible in an applicable topical cream form known as Vitaros.<ref>[https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/28866 Vitaros 3 mg/g cream - Summary of Product Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211142552/https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/28866 |date=2015-02-11 }} Medicines.org.uk</ref> Made by Takeda UK Ltd, it is now available in Europe and contains either 200 or 300 micrograms of alprostadil in 100&nbsp;mg of cream which is directly administered as a topical cream applied to the urethra in a preloaded delivery device. The tip of the device is placed in the urethral meatus and the cream delivered into the urethra. Clinical trials for the treatment showed positive results in over 3000 men that it was tested on, and unlike other sexual dysfunction medication, it is said to be usable by men suffering from diabetes or heart problems and those who have undergone a prostatectomy.<ref>[http://www.meds4all.co.uk/blog/Sexual%20Health/vitaros-erectile-dysfunction.html Vitaros- New Erectile Dysfunction Topical Treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211141258/http://www.meds4all.co.uk/blog/Sexual%20Health/vitaros-erectile-dysfunction.html |date=2015-02-11 }} Meds4All.co.uk</ref> It has no known interactions with food, alcohol or other medications making it safer than other treatments containing alprostadil. Similarly to the Bimix and Trimix injections though, it must be kept under cool temperatures.

=== Critical limb ischemia ===
Alprostadil is also used  for [[critical limb ischemia]]. It increases blood flow by peripheral vasodilation within five minutes and induces angiogenesis. It is most effective when the ankle pressure is at least 30 mmHg and at least one tibial artery is patent.
