'''Pimozide''' (sold under the brand name '''Orap''') is an [[antipsychotic]] [[medication|drug]] of the [[diphenylbutylpiperidine]] class. It was discovered at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in 1963. It has a high potency compared to [[chlorpromazine]] (ratio 50-70:1). On a weight basis it is even more potent than [[haloperidol]]. It also has special neurologic indications for [[Tourette syndrome]] and resistant [[tics]]. The side effects include [[akathisia]], [[tardive dyskinesia]], and, more rarely, [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] and prolongation of the [[QT interval]].

== Medical uses ==
Pimozide is used in its oral preparation in [[schizophrenia]] and chronic [[psychosis]] (on-label indications in Europe only), Tourette syndrome and resistant [[tics]] (Europe, USA and Canada).

Pimozide has been used in the treatment of [[delusional disorder]] and [[paranoid personality disorder]].<ref>Munro, A. (1999)''Delusional disorder''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-58180-X}}.</ref> It has also been used for [[delusions of parasitosis]].<ref name="pmid12639456">{{cite journal |author=van Vloten WA |title=Pimozide: use in dermatology |journal=Dermatol.

== Side effects ==
Very common (>10% frequency) side effects include:<ref name = MSR/><ref name = EMC/><ref name = MD/><ref name = DM/>
* [[Akinesia]]
* Dizziness
* Somnolence
* [[Hyperhidrosis]]
* Nocturia
* Speech disorder
* Dry mouth
* Constipation

===Contraindications===
It is contraindicated in individuals with either acquired, congenital or a family history of QT interval prolongation.<ref name = EMC/> Its use is advised against in individuals with people with either a personal or a family history of arrhythmias or [[torsades de pointes]].<ref name = EMC/> Likewise its use is also advised against in individuals with uncorrected [[hypokalaemia]] and [[hypomagnesaemia]] or clinical significant cardiac disorders (e.g. a recent [[myocardial infarction]] or [[bradycardia]].<ref name =EMC/> It is also contraindicated in individuals being cotreated with [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|SSRIs]] or in those with a known hypersensitivity to pimozide or other diphenylbutyl-piperidine derivatives.<ref name = EMC/> Likewise its use is contraindicated in individuals receiving treatment with [[CYP3A4]], [[CYP1A2]], or [[CYP2D6]] inhibitors.<ref name = EMC/>

===Overdose===
Pimozide overdose presents with severe [[extrapyramidal symptoms]], [[hypotension]], [[sedation]], QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including [[torsades de pointes]].<ref name = EMC/> Gastric lavage, establishment of a patent airway and, if necessary, mechanically assisted respiration is the recommended treatment for pimozide overdose.<ref name = EMC/> Cardiac monitoring should be continued for at least 4 days due to the long half-life of pimozide.<ref name = EMC/>

==Efficacy==
A 2013 [[Systematic review|systematic review]] compared pimozide with other antipsychotics for schizophrenia or related psychoses:

== Pharmacology ==
Pimozide acts as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]], [[D3 receptor|D<sub>3</sub>]], and [[D4 receptor|D<sub>4</sub> receptor]]s and the [[5-HT7 receptor|5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor]]. It is also a [[hERG]] [[channel blocker|blocker]].

Similarly to other typical antipsychotics pimozide has a high affinity for the [[Dopamine D2 receptor|Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] and this likely results in its sexual (due to [[Hyperprolactinaemia|prolactin hypersecretion]]) and extrapyramidal side effects as well as its therapeutic efficacy against the positive symptoms of [[schizophrenia]].<ref name="Maudsley">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-470-97948-8 | title = The Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry | last1 = Taylor | first1 = D |author2=Paton, C; Shitij, K | year = 2012 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = West Sussex  | pages =  }}</ref>
