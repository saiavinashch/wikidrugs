[[File:Alcohol general.svg|180px|thumb|right|The hydroxyl (-OH) functional group with bond angle]]

In [[chemistry]], an '''alcohol''' is any [[organic compound]] in which the [[hydroxyl]] [[functional group]] (–[[oxygen|O]][[hydrogen|H]]) is bound to a [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] [[carbon]] atom.<ref>{{GoldBookRef | title = Alcohols | file = A00204}}</ref> The term alcohol originally referred to the primary alcohol [[ethanol]] (ethyl alcohol), which is [[alcohol (drug)|used as a drug]] and is the main alcohol present in [[alcoholic beverage]]s.

The suffix ''-ol'' appears in the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC chemical name]] of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority; in substances where a higher priority group is present the prefix ''hydroxy-'' will appear in the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) name. The suffix ''-ol'' in non-systematic names (such as [[paracetamol]] or [[cholesterol]]) also typically indicates that the substance includes a hydroxyl functional group and, so, can be termed an alcohol. But many substances, particularly sugars (examples [[glucose]] and [[sucrose]]) contain hydroxyl functional groups without using the suffix. An important class of alcohols, of which [[methanol]] and ethanol are the simplest members is the [[aliphatic compound|saturated straight chain]] alcohols, the general formula for which is C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>OH.

==Nomenclature==

===Etymology===
The word "alcohol" is from the Arabic ''[[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]'' ({{lang-ar|الكحل|al-kuḥl}}), a powder used as an eyeliner.<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=alcohol</ref> [[Al-]] is the Arabic [[Article (grammar)|definite article]], equivalent to ''the'' in English. ''Alcohol'' was originally used for the very fine powder produced by the [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] of the natural mineral [[stibnite]] to form [[antimony trisulfide]] {{chem|Sb|2|S|3}}, hence the essence or "spirit" of this substance. It was used as an [[antiseptic]], eyeliner, and [[kohl (cosmetics)|cosmetic]]. The meaning of alcohol was extended to distilled substances in general, and then narrowed to ethanol, when "spirits" as a synonym for [[Distilled beverage|hard liquor]].<ref name=vias>{{cite web|url=http://www.vias.org/encyclopedia/Alcohol_004.html|title=VIAS Encyclopedia: Etymology of the Word "Alcohol"|first=H.|last=Lohninger|work=vias.org}}</ref>

[[Bartholomew Traheron]], in his 1543 translation of [[John of Vigo]], introduces the word as a term used by "barbarous" ([[Moorish]]) authors for "fine powder." Vigo wrote: "the barbarous auctours use alcohol, or (as I fynde it sometymes wryten) alcofoll, for moost fine poudre."<ref name="oed">"alcohol, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 15 November 2016.</ref>

The 1657 ''Lexicon Chymicum'', by William Johnson glosses the word as "antimonium sive stibium."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lexicon_Chymicum.html?id=d645AAAAcAAJ Lexicon Chymicum]</ref> By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including "alcohol of wine," the distilled essence of wine. [[Libavius]] in ''Alchymia'' (1594) refers to "vini alcohol vel vinum alcalisatum". Johnson (1657) glosses ''alcohol vini'' as "quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat." The word's meaning became restricted to "spirit of wine" (the chemical known today as [[ethanol]]) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as "alcohols" in modern chemistry after 1850.<ref name="oed"/>

The term ''ethanol'' was invented 1892, based on combining the word [[ethane]] with "ol" the last part of "alcohol".<ref>''Proc. Chem. Soc.'' 8 July 1892, page  128   "As ol is indicative of an OH derivative, there seems no reason why the simple word acid should not connote carboxyl, and why al should not connote COH; the names ethanol ethanal and ethanoic acid or simply ethane acid would then stand for the OH, COH and COOH derivatives of ethane."</ref>

===Systematic names===
[[Chemical nomenclature|IUPAC nomenclature]] is used in scientific publications and where precise identification of the substance is important, especially in cases where the relative complexity of the molecule does not make such a systematic name unwieldy. In the IUPAC system, in naming simple alcohols, the name of the alkane chain loses the terminal "e" and adds "ol", ''e.g.'', as in "methanol" and "ethanol".<ref name = reusch-alcohols>{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = VirtualText of Organic Chemistry | title = Alcohols | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/alcohol1.htm#alcnom | accessdate = 14 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070919162404/http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/alcohol1.htm#alcnom| archivedate= 19 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> When necessary, the position of the hydroxyl group is indicated by a number between the alkane name and the "ol": [[propan-1-ol]] for {{chem|CH|3|CH|2|CH|2|OH}}, [[Isopropyl alcohol|propan-2-ol]] for {{chem|CH|3|CH(OH)|CH|3}}. If a higher priority group is present (such as an [[aldehyde]], [[ketone]], or [[carboxylic acid]]), then the prefix "hydroxy" is used,<ref name = reusch-alcohols/> e.g., as in 1-hydroxy-2-propanone ({{chem|CH|3|C(O)|CH|2|OH}}).<ref>Organic chemistry IUPAC nomenclature.

===Common names===
In other less formal contexts, an alcohol is often called with the name of the corresponding alkyl group followed by the word "alcohol", e.g., [[methyl group|methyl]] alcohol, [[ethyl group|ethyl]] alcohol. [[Propyl]] alcohol may be [[propanol|''n''-propyl alcohol]] or [[isopropyl alcohol]], depending on whether the hydroxyl group is bonded to the end or middle carbon on the straight [[propane]] chain. As described under systematic naming, if another group on the molecule takes priority, the alcohol moiety is often indicated using the "hydroxy-" prefix.<ref name="NamingRules">{{cite web|title=How to name organic compounds using the IUPAC rules|url=http://www.chem.uiuc.edu/GenChemReferences/nomenclature_rules.html|website=www.chem.uiuc.edu|publisher=THE DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS|accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref>

{{anchor|secondary|tertiary}}
Alcohols are then classified into primary, secondary (''sec-'', ''s-''), and tertiary (''tert-'', ''t-''), based upon the number of carbon atoms connected to the carbon atom that bears the [[hydroxyl]] [[functional group]]. (The respective numeric shorthands 1°, 2°, and 3° are also sometimes used in informal settings.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Nomenclature of Alcohols|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Organic_Chemistry/Alcohols/Nomenclature_of_Alcohols|website=chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref>) The primary alcohols have general formulas RCH<sub>2</sub>OH. The simplest primary alcohol is methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), for which R=H, and the next is ethanol, for which R=CH<sub>3</sub>, the [[methyl group]]. Secondary alcohols are those of the form RR'CHOH, the simplest of which is 2-propanol (R=R'=CH<sub>3</sub>). For the tertiary alcohols the general form is RR'R"COH. The simplest example is [[tert-butanol]] (2-methylpropan-2-ol), for which each of R, R', and R" is CH<sub>3</sub>. In these shorthands, R, R', and R" represent [[substituents]], alkyl or other attached, generally organic groups.

====Alkyl chain variations in alcohols====
Short-chain alcohols have alkyl chains of 1–3 carbons. Medium-chain alcohols have alkyl chains of 4–7 carbons. Long-chain alcohols (also known as [[fatty alcohols]]) have alkyl chains of 8–21 carbons, and very long-chain alcohols have alkyl chains of 22 carbons or longer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=Short-Chain-Alcohols |title=MetaCyc Compound Class: a short-chain alcohol |accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>

====Simple alcohols====
"Simple alcohols" appears to be a completely undefined term. However, simple alcohols are often referred to by common names derived by adding the word "alcohol" to the name of the appropriate alkyl group. For instance, a chain consisting of one carbon (a methyl group, CH<sub>3</sub>) with an OH group attached to the carbon is called "methyl alcohol" while a chain of two carbons (an ethyl group, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>) with an OH group connected to the CH<sub>2</sub> is called "ethyl alcohol." For more complex alcohols, the IUPAC nomenclature must be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelo.edu/faculty/kboudrea/molecule_gallery/05_alcohols/00_alcohols.htm |title=Molecule Gallery - Alcohols |accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>

Simple alcohols, in particular ethanol and methanol, possess [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] and inert rendering properties, leading to their use as anti-microbial agents in medicine, pharmacy, and industry.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

====Higher alcohols====
[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] states, "The higher alcohols—those containing 4 to 10 carbon atoms—are somewhat viscous, or oily, and they have heavier fruity odours. Some of the highly branched alcohols and many alcohols containing more than 12 carbon atoms are solids at room temperature."<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/13366/alcohol |title=alcohol (chemical compound) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>

Like ethanol, [[n-Butanol|butanol]] can be produced by fermentation processes. Saccharomyces yeast are known to produce these higher alcohols at temperatures above {{convert|75|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. The bacterium ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]]'' can feed on [[cellulose]] to produce butanol on an industrial scale.<ref name="Zverlov et al">{{cite journal|last1=Zverlov|first1=W|last2=Berezina|first2=O|last3=Velikodvorskaya|first3=GA|last4=Schwarz|first4=WH|title=Bacterial acetone and butanol production by industrial fermentation in the Soviet Union: use of hydrolyzed agricultural waste for biorefinery.|journal=Applied Microbiology Technology|date=August 2006|volume=71|issue=5|pages=587–97|doi=10.1007/s00253-006-0445-z|pmid=16685494}}</ref>

==Applications==

Alcohol has a long history of several uses worldwide. It is found in alcoholic beverages sold to adults, as fuel, and also has many scientific, medical, and industrial uses. The term '''alcohol-free''' is often used to describe a product that does not contain alcohol.

* '''[[Alcoholic beverage]]s''', typically containing 3&ndash;40% [[alcohol by volume]], have been produced and consumed by humans since pre-historic times. Natural fermentation also produces trace amounts of other alcohols such as [[2-methyl-2-butanol]] and [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|γ-hydroxybutyric acid]] (GHB), which have psychoactive effects similar to [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol when used as a drug]].
* '''[[Antifreeze]]''' commonly includes a 50% [[Volume fraction|v/v]] (by volume) solution of [[ethylene glycol]] in water.
* '''[[Alcohol (medical use)|Medical]]''': Ethanol can be used as an [[antiseptic]] to disinfect the skin before injections are given, often along with [[iodine]]. Ethanol-based [[soap]]s are becoming common in restaurants and are convenient because they do not require drying due to the volatility of the compound. Alcohol based gels have become common as [[hand sanitizer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* '''[[Alcohol fuel]]''': Some alcohols, mainly [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]], can be used as fuel. Fuel performance can be increased in [[forced induction]] [[internal combustion engine]]s by injecting alcohol into the air intake after the [[turbocharger]] or [[supercharger]] has pressurized the air. This cools the pressurized air, providing a denser air charge, which allows for more fuel, and therefore more power.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
* '''[[Preservative]]''': Alcohol is often used as a preservative for [[biological specimen]]s in the fields of science and medicine.
* '''[[Solvent]]''': Hydroxyl groups (-OH), found in alcohols, are [[Chemical polarity|polar]] and therefore [[hydrophilic]] (water loving) but their carbon chain portion is [[non-polar]] which make them [[hydrophobic]]. The molecule increasingly becomes overall more nonpolar and therefore less soluble in the polar water as the carbon chain becomes longer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.latech.edu/~deddy/chem121/Alcohols.htm |title=Alcohols, Phenols, Thiols, and Ethers |publisher=Chemistry - Louisiana Tech University |accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref> Methanol has the shortest carbon chain of all alcohols (one carbon atom) followed by ethanol (two carbon atoms.) Alcohols have applications in industry and science as reagents or [[solvent]]s. Because of its relatively low toxicity compared with other alcohols and ability to dissolve [[non-polar]] substances, ethanol can be used as a solvent in medical drugs, [[perfume]]s, and vegetable essences such as [[vanilla]]. In [[organic synthesis]], alcohols serve as versatile intermediates.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Other alcohols are substantially more poisonous than ethanol, partly because they take much longer to be metabolized and partly because their metabolism produces substances that are even more toxic. Methanol (wood alcohol), for instance, is oxidized to [[formaldehyde]] and then to the poisonous [[formic acid]] in the liver by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[formaldehyde dehydrogenase]] [[enzyme]]s, respectively; accumulation of formic acid can lead to blindness or death.<ref name="Schep">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Beasley DM |title=A seaman with blindness and confusion |journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=339 |issue= |pages=b3929 |date=30 September 2009|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep30_1/b3929|doi=10.1136/bmj.b3929|pmid=19793790}}</ref> Likewise, poisoning due to other alcohols such as [[ethylene glycol]] or [[diethylene glycol]] are due to their metabolites, which are also produced by alcohol dehydrogenase.<ref name="Brent-2009">{{cite journal |author =Brent J |title=Fomepizole for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning |journal=N.

Methanol itself, while poisonous ([[median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] 5628&nbsp;mg/kg, oral, rat<ref name="chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite web|url=http://chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/|title=ChemIDplus Advanced - Chemical information with searchable synonyms, structures, and formulas|work=nih.gov}}</ref>), has a much weaker [[sedative]] effect than ethanol.

Isopropyl alcohol is oxidized to form acetone by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] in the liver, but has occasionally been abused by [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]], leading to a range of adverse health effects.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wiernikowski | first1 = A | last2 = Piekoszewski | first2 = W | last3 = Krzyzanowska-Kierepka | first3 = E | last4 = Gomułka | first4 = E | title = Acute oral poisoning with isopropyl alcohol in alcoholics | journal = Przeglad lekarski | volume = 54 | issue = 6 | pages = 459–63 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9333902 | name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>{{better source|date=June 2014}}<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mańkowski | first1 = W | last2 = Klimaszyk | first2 = D | last3 = Krupiński | first3 = B | title = How to differentiate acute isopropanol poisoning from ethanol intoxication? – a case report | journal = Przeglad lekarski | volume = 57 | issue = 10 | pages = 588–90 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11199895 | name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>{{better source|date=June 2014}}

===Treatment===
An effective treatment to prevent toxicity after methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion is to administer ethanol. Alcohol dehydrogenase has a higher affinity for ethanol, thus preventing methanol from binding and acting as a [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. Any remaining methanol will then have time to be excreted through the kidneys.<ref name="Schep"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zimmerman | first1 = HE | last2 = Burkhart | first2 = KK | last3 = Donovan | first3 = JW | title = Ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning: diagnosis and treatment | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–20 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10097201 | name-list-format=vanc | doi = 10.1016/S0099-1767(99)70156-X }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lobert | first1 = S | title = Ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, and ethylene glycol poisoning | journal = Critical care nurse | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 41–7 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11878258 | name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>

==Physical and chemical properties==
Alcohols have an odor that is often described as "biting" and as "hanging" in the nasal passages. Ethanol has a slightly sweeter (or more fruit-like) odor than the other alcohols.

In general, the [[hydroxyl group]] makes the alcohol molecule [[polar molecule|polar]]. Those groups can form [[hydrogen bond]]s to one another and to other compounds (except in [[2,2,4,4-Tetramethyl-3-t-butyl-pentane-3-ol|certain large molecules]] where the hydroxyl is protected by [[steric hindrance]] of adjacent groups<ref name="maje">{{cite journal | first=Irena |last1=Majerza |first2= Ireneusz |last2=Natkaniec |year=2006 | title=Experimental and theoretical IR, R, and INS spectra of 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-t-butyl-pentane-3-ol |journal=Journal of Molecular Structure |volume =788 |issue= 1–3 |pages =93–101 | doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2005.11.022  | name-list-format=vanc |bibcode = 2006JMoSt.788...93M }}
</ref>). This hydrogen bonding means that alcohols can be used as [[protic solvent]]s. Two opposing solubility trends in alcohols are: the tendency of the polar OH to promote solubility in water, and the tendency of the carbon chain to resist it. Thus, methanol, ethanol, and propanol are [[miscible]] in water because the hydroxyl group wins out over the short carbon chain. [[n-Butanol|Butanol]], with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends. Alcohols of five or more carbons such as [[amyl alcohol|pentanol]] and higher are effectively insoluble in water because of the hydrocarbon chain's dominance. All simple alcohols are miscible in organic solvents.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Because of [[hydrogen bonding]], alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[ether]]s. The boiling point of the alcohol ethanol is 78.29&nbsp;°C, compared to 69&nbsp;°C for the hydrocarbon [[hexane]] (a common constituent of [[gasoline]]), and 34.6&nbsp;°C for [[diethyl ether]].

Alcohols, like water, can show either acidic or basic properties at the -OH group. With a [[pKa|pK<sub>a</sub>]] of around 16-19, they are, in general, slightly weaker [[acid]]s than [[water (molecule)|water]], but they are still able to react with strong bases such as [[sodium hydride]] or reactive metals such as [[sodium]]. The [[salt]]s that result are called '''[[alkoxide]]s''', with the general formula [[Alkyl|R]]O<sup>−</sup> [[Metal|M]]<sup>+</sup>.

Meanwhile, the oxygen atom has [[lone pair]]s of nonbonded electrons that render it weakly [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] in the presence of strong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]]. For example, with methanol:

[[File:Methanol acid base.gif|500px|Acidity & basicity of methanol]]

Alcohols can be [[oxidised]] to give [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s or [[carboxylic acid]]s, or they can be dehydrated to [[alkene]]s. They can react with carboxylic acids to form [[ester compound]]s, and they can (if activated first) undergo [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions. The lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen of the hydroxyl group also makes alcohols [[nucleophile]]s. For more details, see the [[Alcohol#Reactions|reactions of alcohols]] section below.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Health & Drugs Disease, Prescription & Medication|last=Sfetcu|first=Nicolae|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2014|isbn=9781312039995|location=North Carolina|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>

As one moves from primary to secondary to tertiary alcohols with the same backbone, the hydrogen bond strength, the boiling point, and the acidity typically decrease.

==Occurrence in nature==
[[Ethanol#Natural occurrence|Ethanol occurs naturally]] as a  byproduct of the [[Metabolism|metabolic process]] of yeast. As such, ethanol will be present in any yeast habitat. Ethanol can commonly be found in overripe fruit.

[[Methanol#Occurrence|Methanol is produced naturally]] in the [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[metabolism]] of many varieties of bacteria, and is commonly present in small amounts in the environment.

Alcohols have been found outside the [[Solar System]] at low densities in star-forming regions of interstellar space.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Charnley|first1=S. B.|last2=Kress|first2=M.

==Production==

===Ziegler and oxo processes===
In the [[Ziegler process]], linear alcohols are produced from ethylene and [[triethylaluminium]] followed by oxidation and hydrolysis.<ref name=Falbe>Jürgen Falbe, Helmut Bahrmann, Wolfgang Lipps, Dieter Mayer "Alcohols, Aliphatic" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology'' Wiley-VCH Verlag; Weinheim, 2002. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a01_279}}</ref>  An idealized synthesis of [[1-octanol]] is shown:

:Al(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>  +  9 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>   →  Al(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>3</sub>
:Al(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>3</sub> +  3 O  +  3 H<sub>2</sub>O  →  3 HOC<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>  +  Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>

The process generates a range of alcohols that are separated by [[distillation]].

Many higher alcohols are produced by [[hydroformylation]] of alkenes followed by hydrogenation. When applied to a terminal alkene, as is common, one typically obtains a linear alcohol:<ref name=Falbe/>

:RCH=CH<sub>2</sub>  +  H<sub>2</sub>  +  CO   →  RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO
:RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO +  3 H<sub>2</sub>  →  RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH

Such processes give [[fatty alcohol]]s, which are useful for detergents.

===Hydration reactions===
Low molecular weight alcohols of industrial importance are produced by the addition of water to alkenes. Ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol are produced by this general method. Two implementations are employed, the direct and indirect methods. The direct method avoids the formation of stable intermediates, typically using acid catalysts. In the indirect method, the alkene is converted to the [[sulfate ester]], which is subsequently hydrolyzed. The direct [[hydration reaction|hydration]] using [[ethylene]] ([[Ethanol#Ethylene hydration|ethylene hydration]])<ref name="ECT4 820">{{cite book |author =Lodgsdon J.E. |year=1994 |chapter=Ethanol |editor=Kroschwitz J.I. |title=Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology| edition=4th |volume=9 |page=820 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0-471-52677-0}}</ref> or other alkenes from [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of fractions of distilled [[crude oil]].

Hydration is also used industrially to produce the diol [[ethylene glycol]] from [[ethylene oxide]].

===Biological routes===
Ethanol is obtained by [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] using [[glucose]] produced from sugar from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[starch]], in the presence of yeast and temperature of less than 37&nbsp;°C to produce ethanol. For instance, such a process might proceed by the conversion of [[sucrose]] by the enzyme [[invertase]] into [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], then the conversion of [[glucose]] by the enzyme complex [[zymase]] into [[ethanol]] (and carbon dioxide).

Several of the benign bacteria in the intestine use [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] as a form of [[anaerobic metabolism]]. This [[metabolism|metabolic]] reaction produces [[ethanol]] as a waste product, just like [[aerobic respiration]] produces [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water (molecule)|water]]. Thus, human bodies contain some quantity of alcohol endogenously produced by these bacteria. In rare cases, this can be sufficient to cause "[[auto-brewery syndrome]]" in which intoxicating quantities of alcohol are produced.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01873798 |title=Endogenous alcohol production by intestinal fermentation in sudden infant death |author1=P.

====Substitution====
Primary [[alkyl halide]]s react with aqueous [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] mainly to primary alcohols in [[nucleophilic aliphatic substitution]]. (Secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination (alkene) product instead). [[Grignard reagent]]s react with [[carbonyl]] groups to secondary and tertiary alcohols. Related reactions are the [[Barbier reaction]] and the [[Nozaki-Hiyama reaction]].

====Reduction====
[[Aldehydes]] or [[ketone]]s are [[redox|reduced]] with [[sodium borohydride]] or [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (after an acidic workup). Another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates is the [[Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction]]. [[Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation]] is the asymmetric reduction of β-keto-esters.

====Hydrolysis====
[[Alkenes]] engage in an acid catalysed [[hydration reaction]] using concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst that gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols. The [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and [[oxymercuration-reduction]] of alkenes are more reliable in organic synthesis. Alkenes react with NBS and water in [[halohydrin formation reaction]]. [[Amine]]s can be converted to [[diazonium salt]]s, which are then hydrolyzed.

The formation of a secondary alcohol via reduction and hydration is shown:

==Reactions==<!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -->

===Deprotonation===
Alcohols behave as weak acids, undergoing [[deprotonation]], but strong bases are required. The deprotonation reaction to produce an [[alkoxide]] salt is performed with a strong base such as sodium hydride or sodium metal.
: 2 R-OH + 2 NaH  → 2 R-O<sup>−</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>

: 2 R-OH + 2 Na   →   2 R-O<sup>−</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>

Water is similar in [[pKa|pK<sub>a</sub>]] to many alcohols, so with [[sodium hydroxide]] an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] exists, which usually lies to the left:
: R-OH + NaOH ⇌ R-O<sup>−</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O (equilibrium to the left)

The acidity of alcohols is strongly affected by [[solvation]].  In the gas phase, alcohols are more acidic than is water.<ref>{{March6th}}</ref>

===Nucleophilic substitution===
The OH group is not a good [[leaving group]] in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R−OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, the leaving group ([[water (molecule)|water]]) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce tertiary [[alkyl halide]]s, where the [[hydroxyl group]] is replaced by a [[chlorine]] atom by [[unimolecular nucleophilic substitution]]. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]], an activator such as [[zinc chloride]] is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using [[thionyl chloride]].<sup>[1]</sup>

[[File:Alcohol reaction examples.gif|700px|Some simple conversions of alcohols to alkyl chlorides]]

Alcohols may, likewise, be converted to alkyl bromides using [[hydrobromic acid]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]], for example:

: 3 R-OH + PBr<sub>3</sub> → 3 RBr + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>

In the [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] an alcohol is deoxygenated to an [[alkane]] with [[organotin|tributyltin hydride]] or a [[organoborane|trimethylborane]]-water complex in a [[radical substitution]] reaction.

===Dehydration===
Alcohols are themselves nucleophilic, so R−OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> can react with ROH to produce [[ether]]s and water in a [[dehydration reaction]], although this reaction is rarely used except in the manufacture of [[diethyl ether]].

More useful is the E1 [[elimination reaction]] of alcohols to produce [[alkene]]s. The reaction, in general, obeys [[Zaitsev's Rule]], which states that the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed. Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary alcohols require a higher temperature.

This is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce [[ethene]]:

[[File:DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png|550px]]

A more controlled elimination reaction is the [[Chugaev elimination]] with [[carbon disulfide]] and [[iodomethane]].

===Esterification===
To form an [[ester]] from an alcohol and a [[carboxylic acid]] the reaction, known as [[Fischer esterification]], is usually performed at [[reflux]] with a [[catalyst]] of concentrated sulfuric acid:

: R-OH + R'-COOH → R'-COOR + H<sub>2</sub>O

In order to drive the equilibrium to the right and produce a good [[yield (chemistry)|yield]] of ester, water is usually removed, either by an excess of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or by using a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]]. Esters may also be prepared by reaction of the alcohol with an [[acid chloride]] in the presence of a base such as [[pyridine]].

Other types of ester are prepared in a similar manner{{snd}} for example, [[tosyl]] (tosylate) esters are made by reaction of the alcohol with p-[[toluenesulfonyl]] chloride in pyridine.

===Oxidation===
{{Main article|Alcohol oxidation}}
Primary alcohols (R-CH<sub>2</sub>-OH) can be oxidized either to [[aldehyde]]s (R-CHO) or to [[carboxylic acid]]s (R-CO<sub>2</sub>H), while the oxidation of secondary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>CH-OH) normally terminates at the [[ketone]] (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>C=O) stage. Tertiary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3</sup>C-OH) are resistant to oxidation.

The direct [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an ''aldehyde hydrate'' (R-CH(OH)<sub>2</sub>) by reaction with water before it can be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid.

[[File:Alcohol to aldehyde to acid.png|500px|thumb|center|Mechanism of [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] via aldehydes and aldehyde hydrates]]

Reagents useful for the transformation of primary alcohols to aldehydes are normally also suitable for the [[oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones]]. These include [[Collins reagent]] and [[Dess-Martin periodinane]]. The direct oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids can be carried out using [[potassium permanganate]] or the [[Jones reagent]].
