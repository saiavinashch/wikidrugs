'''Bausch + Lomb''', an American company founded in [[Rochester, New York]], is one of the world's largest suppliers of eye health products, including [[contact lens]]es, lens care products, medicines and [[implant (medicine)|implant]]s for eye diseases. The company was founded in 1853 by an optician, [[John Jacob Bausch]], and a financier, [[Henry Lomb]].<ref name="B&L History">{{cite web|url=http://www.bausch.com/en_US/corporate/corpcomm/general/story.aspx |accessdate=2007-04-19 |title=Bausch & Lomb: The Bausch + Lomb story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501210602/http://www.bausch.com/en_US/corporate/corpcomm/general/story.aspx |archivedate=1 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Its [[Ray-Ban]] brand of [[sunglasses]] was sold in 1999 to the Italian [[Luxottica]] Group.

==Company history==

===Early years===
[[File:US-NY(1891) p639 ROCHESTER, THE BAUSCH & LOMB OPTICAL COMPANY.jpg|thumb|right|250px|New York headquarters of the Bausch & Lomb Optical Company in 1891]]
Bausch + Lomb was founded in 1853 by [[Mr. John Jacob Bausch]] and [[Mr. Henry Lomb]], both German immigrants, in Rochester, New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=18|title = John Bausch|date = 2014|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = Immigrant Entrepreneurship: The German-American Business Biography, 1720 to the Present|publisher = |last = Kolbow|first = Berti}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.germanheritage.com/biographies/atol/bausch.html|title=German American Corner|publisher=German Heritage|date=2014}}</ref> A trained [[optician]], Bausch found in Lomb the financier and partner he needed for a small but ambitious workshop producing [[monocle]]s. In 1861, the company manufactured [[Vulcanization|Vulcanite]] [[rubber]] eyeglass frames and other precision vision products.<ref name="Kingslake">{{cite web |url= http://www.nwmangum.com/Kodak/Rochester.html#Bausch%20and%20Lomb |title= A History of Bausch and Lomb |work= nwmangum.com |quote= Source: Kingslake, Rudolf, 1974, ''The Rochester Camera and Lens Companies'', Rochester NY, Photographic Historical Society. }}</ref>

===Early growth of the company===
During the [[American Civil War]], the [[Union blockade]] caused the price of gold and European horn to rise dramatically. This resulted in a growing demand for the Bausch & Lomb spectacles made from Vulcanite.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In 1876, [[Ernst Gundlach]] joined the company and the company began manufacturing [[microscope]]s. Later that year, the Bausch & Lomb Optical Company won a distinction at the Philadelphia [[Centennial Exposition]]. The company also produced [[photographic lens]]es (1883), [[spectacle lens]]es (1889), [[microtome]]s (1890), [[binoculars]] and [[telescope]]s (1893).<ref name="LOMBbio">[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAlomb.htm Henry Lomb bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026134714/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAlomb.htm |date=2007-10-26 }}</ref> From 1892 in cooperation with [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] in Germany, the company produced optical [[Lens (optics)|lenses]]. In this manner, at the end of the 19th century, the product range included [[eyeglasses]], microscopes and binoculars, as well as [[Movie projector|projector]]s, [[camera lens]]es and [[Diaphragm (optics)|camera diaphragms]].

===Expansion of production at the beginning of the 20th century===
With the growth of the US army, under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and the buildup of the naval fleet, Bausch & Lomb received the commission, through the supplier [[George N. Saegmuller|Saegmuller]], to manufacture high-precision lenses for optical measurement and founded a [[joint venture]] with Saegmuller. At the same time as this new expansion, a research department with five members was started to develop new products and improve old ones. A new alliance with the Zeiss company in Germany ensured competitive advantages for the three participants, Bausch & Lomb, Saegmuller and Zeiss, in terms of patent use and opening new markets.  In 1902, William Bausch, the son of the founder, developed a process to create the desired lens shape directly by casting molten glass. Previously, the glass parts for the lenses had to be separated, ground and polished in a complicated process, and this brought significant savings in time and materials.

The company produced the first optical-quality glass in America during the early to mid-1900s. By the year 1903 the company began manufacturing microscopes, binoculars, and [[camera shutter]]s.

===The First and Second World Wars===
The further development of the firm was affected by political events. Because of the World Wars and the consequent need for optical instruments such as field glasses, target finders, camera lenses, binocular telescopes, searchlight mirrors, torpedo tube sights, and [[periscope]]s, the product range could be considerably broadened. Until [[World War I]], optical glass and the instruments made from it (including many military instruments) were often imported into most European and North American countries from Germany. The same was also true of chemical products and laboratory equipment. The outbreak of the war, with Germany's new enemy status, created a scramble to rapidly enhance the domestic industries.<ref name="PopSci1920v96n2_BLadvert">{{Citation |author=Bausch & Lomb Optical Company |date=February 1920|title=The end of a foreign monopoly (Bausch & Lomb Optical Company advertisement) |journal=Popular Science |volume=96 |issue=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PP2#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.}}</ref> In 1933, Bausch+Lomb started to honor outstanding high school science students with the Bausch+Lomb Honorary Science Award. In the 1930s, military products represented 70% of total production. The Ray-Ban brand of sunglasses was developed for pilots in 1936.

===Period after 1945===
At a time when the cinema was being superseded by television, Bausch & Lomb developed improved optics for the [[CinemaScope]] process, which popularized the film-based [[anamorphic format]] and led most cinemas to double the widths of their screens.

After three years of development work, two years for the medical approval by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and an investment of three million USD, Bausch + Lomb brought the first [[contact lens]]es made of Poly-HEMA on the market in 1971. In contrast to the contact lenses available up to that time, made of glass and Lucite ([[acrylic glass]]),<ref>[http://www.luciteinternational.com/ The global leader in acrylics]. Lucite International (2011-07-14). Retrieved on 2013-08-23.</ref> the new lenses were softer, and were marketed with the brand name "Soflens".

In the 1970s, Bausch + Lomb became a major producer of [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometers]] for the dye and chemical business such as the [[Spectronic 20]].

A massive restructuring of the company began in the mid-80s. What had been the core divisions, the production of lenses for various purposes, were sold off. The sunglasses division was continued, since [[Ray-Ban]] glasses kept selling very well due to effective [[product placement]]. By the planned acquisition of other firms, such as Polymer Technology Corporation and Dr. Mann Pharma, existing business areas, for example contact lens production, were strengthened and new ones were opened up. Finally in 1997, as a result of a series of company acquisitions, the division for the production of surgical products was established.

===Company developments in recent years===
[[File:Bausch and Lomb Logo.svg|thumb|Logo in use from 2004 until January 2010]]

Since then, Bausch & Lomb has developed into a globally operating company which is one of the largest producers of contact lenses. Today, about 13,000 employees in 36 countries work for the firm. Total turnover for the year 2006 was estimated{{by whom|date=March 2013}} at 2.29 billion USD.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The company's competitors in the international eye care products market are [[Johnson & Johnson]], [[Allergan, Plc|Allergan]], [[Alcon]] and Ciba Vision ([[Novartis]]), [[MSD-Chibret]] and [[CooperVision]].

==Business areas==
[[Image:Bausch & Lomb Vision Care campus.JPG|thumb|right|The Global Eye Health Center in [[Rochester, New York]]]]
Basically, the business areas are divided into three large divisions:
* Vision Care: contact lenses and eye-care products.
* Pharmaceuticals: medicines for various eye diseases and irritations.
* Surgery: aids and implants.

In the last few years, several business areas in the Vision Care division have been developed in the framework of product diversification. The manufacturing of contact lenses still accounted for 28% of Bausch & Lomb's turnover in 2001, making it its main business activity. The "SofLens One Day" soft contact lens range have to be changed every day. The product assortment includes higher quality lenses, such as the "SofLens Comfort" or "Seequence" lenses which can be changed after two weeks. The "SofLens66 Toric" were specially designed for people with [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bausch.com/our-products/contact-lenses/lenses-for-astigmatism|title=Contact Lenses For Astigmatism – Astigmatism is a common vision condition – Find contact lenses to help correct astigmatism : Bausch + Lomb|website=www.bausch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-24}}</ref> Lenses from the "Boston" range have a higher oxygen permeability and are more suited for people with sensitive or dry eyes. The newest and most advanced lens range is called "PureVision". These lenses are so oxygen-permeable that they can remain in the eye up to 30 days without being taken out at night. The second largest business, at 25%, is the manufacture of lens-care products. As well as simple combination cleaning and disinfectant solutions for both soft and hard lenses, pH neutral solutions are available for people with particularly sensitive eyes.

The Pharmaceuticals division manufactures pharmaceutical eye products, which account for 21% of turnover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bausch.com/our-products/rx-pharmaceutical|title=Rx Prescription Products : Bausch + Lomb|website=www.bausch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-24}}</ref> This range covers prescription medicines for eye irritation, allergic reactions or high eye pressure. A further breakthrough is expected from the new Envision TD product range. This represents a new process for the precisely located dispensing of active substances to the eye. This is achieved by medical implants behind the eye. Due to the body's absorption process, the implant slowly decomposes and in so doing releases the desired active substance directly to the eye over a long period. Additionally, vitamins can be dispensed to counteract bacterial infection and allergic reactions, thus reducing loss of vision with advancing age. The development of this division was speeded up by take-overs of other firms.

The Surgicals division is divided into Refractive Surgery with 8% of turnover and Cataract Vitreotinal Surgery with 18%. The latter division is concerned with products for operations on glaucoma and cataracts and on the cornea, as well as implantable, interocular lenses. The Refractive Surgery division comprises mainly medical analysis devices and lasers required for eye surgery. In order to strengthen this division, the competing, market-leader companies Storz and Chiron were acquired.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bauschsurgical.eu/our-company/bausch-lomb-surgical/|title=Bausch + Lomb Surgical|website=www.bauschsurgical.eu|access-date=2017-05-24}}</ref>

===PureVision===
Bausch + Lomb was in a lawsuit with [[Novartis]] which claimed to have [[patent]]s on a Bausch + Lomb product called '''PureVision'''. On June 26, 2002, a federal judge ruled that Bausch & Lomb did infringe on [[Ciba Vision]] (a subsidiary of Alcon) patents.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news

But as of now, the brand FreshLook comes under Bausch and Lomb and Ciba manufacturers it.<ref name="Settlement" />

===Biotrue Solutions and Contact Lenses===
Biotrue contact lens solutions are a brand of cleaning and storage solutions manufactured by Bausch & Lomb that were developed to match the natural lubricant found in the eye.  It matches the [[pH]] of healthy tears and helps to keep certain beneficial tear proteins active while removing deposited proteins that distort a wearers vision.  In theory this helps to keep a users contact lenses more comfortable.  In 2012 an affordable line of daily disposable contact lenses were launched under the same brand name for both single vision and for users with [[presbyopia]].  They were first introduced in Italy and quickly followed by the United Kingdom and the Nordics.  In 2015 they were approved for the US market.  Biotrue one day contact lenses are made from a material called [[HyperGel]] and manufactured in the country of [[Ireland]].

===ReNu product recalls===
:{{main article|ReNu}}
On April 11, 2006, Bausch & Lomb stopped shipments of its [[ReNu]] with MoistureLoc contact lens solution when the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) announced there was a high correlation between use of the product and cases of suspected fungal [[keratitis]].<ref name="CDC">{{cite news
