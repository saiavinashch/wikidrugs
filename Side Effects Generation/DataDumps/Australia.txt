With the loss of its American colonies in 1783, the British Government sent a fleet of ships, the "[[First Fleet]]", under the command of Captain [[Arthur Phillip]], to establish a new [[penal colony]] in New South Wales. A camp was set up and the flag raised at [[Sydney Cove]], [[Port Jackson]], on 26 January 1788,{{r|Davison pp. 157, 254}} a date which became Australia's national day, [[Australia Day]], although the British [[British Overseas Territories|Crown Colony]] of New South Wales was not formally promulgated until 7 February 1788. The first settlement led to the foundation of [[Sydney]], and the exploration and settlement of other regions.

===States and territories===
{{Main article|States and territories of Australia}}
{{Australia states imagemap}}

Australia has six states—[[New South Wales]] (NSW), [[Queensland]] (QLD), [[South Australia]] (SA), [[Tasmania]] (TAS), [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (VIC) and [[Western Australia]] (WA)—and two major mainland territories—the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) and the [[Northern Territory]] (NT). In most respects these two territories function as states, except that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to modify or repeal any legislation passed by the territory parliaments.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s122.html Australian Constitution, section 122] - Australian Legal Information Institute website.</ref>

Under the constitution, the States essentially have [[Plenary power|plenary legislative power]] to legislate on any subject, whereas the Commonwealth (federal) Parliament may legislate only within the subject areas enumerated under [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|section 51]]. For example, State parliaments have the power to legislate with respect to education, criminal law and state police, health, transport, and local government, but the Commonwealth Parliament does not have any specific power to legislate in these areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-government/state-and-territory-government|title=State and Territory Government|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> However, Commonwealth laws prevail over State laws to the extent of the inconsistency.<ref>[[Section 109 of the Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution, section 109]].</ref> In addition, the Commonwealth has the [[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|power to levy income tax]] which, coupled with the [[Section 96 of the Constitution of Australia|power to make grants to States]], has given it the financial means to incentivize States to pursue specific legislative agendas within areas over which the Commonwealth does not have legislative power.

Each state and major mainland territory has its own [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|parliament]]—[[unicameralism|unicameral]] in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the [[Legislative Assembly]] (the [[House of Assembly]] in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the [[Legislative council|Legislative Council]]. The [[head of government|head of the government]] in each state is the [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]] and in each territory the [[Chief Minister]]. The Queen is represented in each state by a [[Governors of the Australian states|Governor]]; and in the Northern Territory, the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory|Administrator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/administrator/administrator.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430111225/http://www.nt.gov.au/administrator/administrator.shtml|archivedate=30 April 2013|publisher=Government House Northern Territory|title=Role of the Administrator|date=16 June 2008|accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref> In the Commonwealth, the Queen's representative is the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/governorgeneral/category.php?id=2|publisher=Governor–General of the Commonwealth of Australia|title=Governor-General's Role|accessdate=30 March 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804130529/http://www.gg.gov.au/governorgeneral/category.php?id=2| archivedate = 4 August 2008}}</ref>

The Commonwealth Parliament also directly administers the following external territories: [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]]; [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]; [[Christmas Island]]; [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]; [[Coral Sea Islands]]; [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]]; and [[Jervis Bay Territory]], a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales.<ref name="CIAfactbook" /> The external territory of [[Norfolk Island]] previously exercised considerable autonomy under the ''Norfolk Island Act 1979'' through its own legislative assembly and an [[List of administrative heads of Norfolk Island|Administrator]] to represent the Queen.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806021653/http://ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Territories_of_AustraliaNorfolk_IslandAdministrator_of_Norfolk_Island|url=http://ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Territories_of_AustraliaNorfolk_Island |publisher=Australian Government Attorney-General's Department |title=Administrator of Norfolk Island|archivedate=6 August 2008}}</ref> In 2015, the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government, integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/12/norfolk-island-loses-its-parliament-as-canberra-takes-control|title=Norfolk Island loses its parliament as Canberra takes control|author1=Monica Tan|author2=Australian Associated Press|date=12 May 2015|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> [[Macquarie Island]] is administered by Tasmania, and [[Lord Howe Island]] by New South Wales.

===Foreign relations and military===
{{Main article|Foreign relations of Australia|Australian Defence Force}}
Over recent decades, [[Foreign relations of Australia|Australia's foreign relations]] have been driven by a close association with the United States through the [[ANZUS|ANZUS pact]], and by a desire to develop relationships with Asia and the Pacific, particularly through [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. In 2005 Australia secured an inaugural seat at the [[East Asia Summit]] following its accession to the [[Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia]], and in 2011 attended the [[Sixth East Asia Summit]] in Indonesia.

Before European settlement, the animist beliefs of Australia's indigenous people had been practised for many thousands of years. Mainland [[Aboriginal Australians]]' spirituality is known as the [[Dreamtime]] and it places a heavy emphasis on belonging to the land. The collection of stories that it contains shaped Aboriginal law and customs. [[Indigenous Australian art|Aboriginal art]], story and dance continue to draw on these spiritual traditions. The spirituality and customs of [[Torres Strait Islanders]], who inhabit the islands between Australia and New Guinea, reflected their Melanesian origins and dependence on the sea. The 1996 Australian census counted more than 7000 respondents as followers of a traditional Aboriginal religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s790117.htm |title=Indigenous Traditions – Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=14 December 1999 |accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref>

Since the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] of British ships in 1788, Christianity has grown to be the major religion practised in Australia. Christian churches have played an integral role in the development of education, health and welfare services in Australia. For much of Australian history, the [[Church of England]] (now known as the [[Anglican Church of Australia]]) was the largest religious denomination. However, multicultural immigration has contributed to a decline in its relative position, and the Roman Catholic Church has benefitted from recent immigration to become the largest group. Similarly, [[Islam in Australia|Islam]], [[Buddhism in Australia|Buddhism]], [[Hinduism in Australia|Hinduism]] and [[History of the Jews in Australia|Judaism]] have all grown in Australia over the past half-century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/CO-61?opendocument&navpos=620|title=2011 Census reveals Hinduism as the fastest growing religion in Australia|publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref>
